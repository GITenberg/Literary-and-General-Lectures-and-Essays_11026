<h2>THE STAGE AS IT WAS ONCE <a name="citation1"></a><a href="#footnote1">{1}</a></h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Let us think for a while upon what the Stage was once, in a republic
of the past&mdash;what it may be again, I sometimes dream, in some republic
of the future.&nbsp; In order to do this, let me take you back in fancy
some 2314 years&mdash;440 years before the Christian era, and try to
sketch for you&mdash;alas! how clumsily&mdash;a great, though tiny people,
in one of their greatest moments&mdash;in one of the greatest moments,
it may be, of the human race.&nbsp; For surely it is a great and a rare
moment for humanity, when all that is loftiest in it&mdash;when reverence
for the Unseen powers, reverence for the heroic dead, reverence for
the fatherland, and that reverence, too, for self, which is expressed
in stateliness and self-restraint, in grace and courtesy; when all these,
I say, can lend themselves, even for a day, to the richest enjoyment
of life&mdash;to the enjoyment of beauty in form and sound, and of relaxation,
not brutalising, but ennobling.</p>
<p>Rare, alas! have such seasons been in the history of poor humanity.&nbsp;
But when they have come, they have lifted it up one stage higher thenceforth.&nbsp;
Men, having been such once, may become such again; and the work which
such times have left behind them becomes immortal.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>A thing of beauty is a joy for ever.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Let me take you to the then still unfurnished theatre of Athens,
hewn out of the limestone rock on the south-east slope of the Acropolis.</p>
<p>Above are the new marble buildings of the Parthenon, rich with the
statues and bas-reliefs of Phidias and his scholars, gleaming white
against the blue sky, with the huge bronze statue of Athen&eacute; Promachos,
fifty feet in height, towering up among the temples and colonnades.&nbsp;
In front, and far below, gleams the blue sea, and Salamis beyond.</p>
<p>And there are gathered the people of Athens&mdash;fifty thousand
of them, possibly, when the theatre was complete and full.&nbsp; If
it be fine, they all wear garlands on their heads.&nbsp; If the sun
be too hot, they wear wide-brimmed straw hats.&nbsp; And if a storm
comes on, they will take refuge in the porticoes beneath; not without
wine and cakes, for what they have come to see will last for many an
hour, and they intend to feast their eyes and ears from sunrise to sunset.&nbsp;
On the highest seats are slaves and freedmen, below them the free citizens;
and on the lowest seats of all are the dignitaries of the republic&mdash;the
priests, the magistrates, and the other &kappa;&alpha;&lambda;&omicron;&iota;
&kappa;&alpha;y&alpha;&theta;&iota;&mdash;the fair and good men&mdash;as
the citizens of the highest rank were called, and with them foreign
ambassadors and distinguished strangers.&nbsp; What an audience! the
rapidest, subtlest, wittiest, down to the very cobblers and tinkers,
the world has ever seen.&nbsp; And what noble figures on those front
seats; Pericles, with Aspasia beside him, and all his friends&mdash;Anaxagoras
the sage, Phidias the sculptor, and many another immortal artist; and
somewhere among the free citizens, perhaps beside his father Sophroniscus
the sculptor, a short, square, pug-nosed boy of ten years old, looking
at it all with strange eyes&mdash;&ldquo;who will be one day,&rdquo;
so said the Pythoness at Delphi, &ldquo;the wisest man in Greece&rdquo;&mdash;sage,
metaphysician, humorist, warrior, patriot, martyr&mdash;for his name
is <i>Socrates</i>.</p>
<p>All are in their dresses of office; for this is not merely a day
of amusement, but of religions ceremony; sacred to Dionysos&mdash;Bacchus,
the inspiring god, who raises men above themselves, for good&mdash;or
for evil.</p>
<p>The evil, or at least the mere animal aspect of that inspiration,
was to be seen in forms grotesque and sensuous enough in those very
festivals, when the gayer and coarser part of the population, in town
and country, broke out into frantic masquerade&mdash;of which the silly
carnival of Rome is perhaps the last paltry and unmeaning relic&mdash;&ldquo;when,&rdquo;
as the learned O. M&uuml;ller says, &ldquo;the desire of escaping from
self into something new and strange, of living in an imaginary world,
broke forth in a thousand ways; not merely in revelry and solemn though
fantastic songs, but in a hundred disguises, imitating the subordinate
beings&mdash;satyrs, pans, and nymphs, by whom the god was surrounded,
and through whom life seemed to pass from him into vegetation, and branch
off into a variety of beautiful or grotesque forms&mdash;beings who
were ever present to the fancy of the Greeks, as a convenient step by
which they could approach more nearly to the presence of the Divinity.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But even out of that seemingly bare chaos, Athenian genius was learning
how to construct, under Eupolis, Cratinus, and Aristophanes, that elder
school of comedy, which remains not only unsurpassed, but unapproachable,
save by Rabelais alone, as the ideal cloudland of masquerading wisdom,
in which the whole universe goes mad&mdash;but with a subtle method
in its madness.</p>
<p>Yes, so it has been, under some form or other, in every race and
clime&mdash;ever since Eve ate of the magic fruit, that she might be
as a god, knowing good and evil, and found, poor thing, as most have
since, that it was far easier and more pleasant to know the evil than
to know the good.&nbsp; But that theatre was built that men might know
therein the good as well as the evil.&nbsp; To learn the evil, indeed,
according to their light, and the sure vengeance of At&eacute; and the
Furies which tracks up the evil-doer.&nbsp; But to learn also the good&mdash;lessons
of piety, patriotism, heroism, justice, mercy, self-sacrifice, and all
that comes out of the hearts of men and women not dragged <i>below</i>,
but raised <i>above</i> themselves; and behind all&mdash;at least in
the nobler and earlier tragedies of &AElig;schylus and Sophocles, before
Euripides had introduced the tragedy of mere human passion; that sensation
tragedy, which is the only one the world knows now, and of which the
world is growing rapidly tired&mdash;behind all, I say, lessons of the
awful and unfathomable mystery of human existence&mdash;of unseen destiny;
of that seemingly capricious distribution of weal and woe, to which
we can find no solution on this side the grave, for which the old Greek
could find no solution whatsoever.</p>
<p>Therefore there was a central object in the old Greek theatre, most
important to it, but which did not exist in the old Roman, and does
not exist in our theatres, because our tragedies, like the Roman, are
mere plays concerning love, murder, and so forth, while the Greek were
concerning the deepest relations of man to the Unseen.</p>
<p>The almost circular orchestra, or pit, between the benches and the
stage, was empty of what we call spectators&mdash;because it was destined
for the true and ideal spectators&mdash;the representatives of humanity;
in its centre was a round platform, the &theta;&upsilon;&mu;&epsilon;&lambda;&eta;&mdash;originally
the altar of Bacchus&mdash;from which the leader of these representatives,
the leader of the Chorus, could converse with the actors on the stage
and take his part in the drama; and round this thymel&eacute; the Chorus
ranged with measured dance and song, chanting, to the sound of a simple
flute, odes such as the world had never heard before or since, save
perhaps in the temple-worship at Jerusalem.&nbsp; A chorus now, as you
know, merely any number of persons singing in full harmony on any subject.&nbsp;
The Chorus was then in tragedy, and indeed in the higher comedy, what
Schlegel well calls &ldquo;the ideal spectator&rdquo;&mdash;a personified
reflection on the action going on, the incorporation into the representation
itself of the sentiments of the poet, as the spokesman of the whole
human race.&nbsp; He goes on to say (and I think truly), &ldquo;that
the Chorus always retained among the Greeks a peculiar national signification,
publicity being, according to their republican notions, essential to
the completeness of every important transaction.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus the
Chorus represented idealised public opinion; not, of course, the shifting
hasty public opinion of the moment&mdash;to that it was a conservative
check, and it calmed it to soberness and charity&mdash;for it was the
matured public opinion of centuries; the experience, and usually the
sad experience, of many generations; the very spirit of the Greek race.</p>
<p>The Chorus might be composed of what the poet would.&nbsp; Of ancient
citizens, waiting for their sons to come back from the war, as in the
&ldquo;Agamemnon&rdquo; of &AElig;schylus; of sea-nymphs, as in his
&ldquo;Prometheus Bound;&rdquo; even of the very Furies who hunt the
matricide, as in his &ldquo;Eumenides;&rdquo; of senators, as in the
&ldquo;Antigone&rdquo; of Sophocles; or of village farmers, as in his
&ldquo;&OElig;dipus at Colonos&rdquo;&mdash;and now I have named five
of the greatest poems, as I hold, written by mortal man till Dante rose.&nbsp;
Or it may be the Chorus was composed&mdash;as in the comedies of Aristophanes,
the greatest humorist the world has ever seen&mdash;of birds, or of
frogs, or even of clouds.&nbsp; It may rise to the level of Don Quixote,
or sink to that of Sancho Panza; for it is always the incarnation of
such wisdom, heavenly or earthly, as the poet wishes the people to bring
to bear on the subject-matter.</p>
<p>But let the poets themselves, rather than me, speak awhile.&nbsp;
Allow me to give you a few specimens of these choruses&mdash;the first
as an example of that practical and yet surely not un-divine wisdom,
by which they supplied the place of our modern preacher, or essayist,
or didactic poet.</p>
<p>Listen to this of the old men&rsquo;s chorus in the &ldquo;Agamemnon,&rdquo;
in the spirited translation of my friend Professor Blackie:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Twas said of old, and &rsquo;tis said to-day,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That
wealth to prosperous stature grown<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Begets
a birth of its own:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That a surfeit of evil by
good is prepared,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sons must bear what allotment
of woe<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their sires were spared.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But
this I refuse to believe: I know<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That
impious deeds conspire<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To beget an offspring
of impious deeds<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too like their
ugly sire.<br />But whoso is just, though his wealth like a river<br />Flow
down, shall be scathless: his house shall rejoice<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
an offspring of beauty for ever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of the haughty delights to beget<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
haughty heart.&nbsp; From time to time<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In children&rsquo;s
children recurrent appears<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
ancestral crime.<br />When the dark hour comes that the gods have decreed<br />And
the Fury burns with wrathful fires,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A demon unholy,
with ire unabated,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lies like black night on the
halls of the fated;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the recreant Son plunges
guiltily on<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To perfect the
guilt of his Sires.</p>
<p>But Justice shines in a lowly cell;<br />In the homes of poverty,
smoke-begrimed,<br />With the sober-minded she loves to dwell.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But
she turns aside<br />From the rich man&rsquo;s house with averted eye,<br />The
golden-fretted halls of pride<br />Where hands with lucre are foul,
and the praise<br />Of counterfeit goodness smoothly sways;<br />And
wisely she guides in the strong man&rsquo;s despite<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All
things to an issue of RIGHT.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Let me now give you another passage from the &ldquo;Eumenides&rdquo;&mdash;or
&ldquo;Furies&rdquo;&mdash;of &AElig;schylus.</p>
<p>Orestes, Prince of Argos, you must remember, has avenged on his mother
Clytemnestra the murder of his father, King Agamemnon, on his return
from Troy.&nbsp; Pursued by the Furies, he takes refuge in the temple
of Apollo at Delphi, and then, still Fury-haunted, goes to Athens, where
Pallas Athen&eacute;, the warrior-maiden, the tutelary goddess of Athens,
bids him refer his cause to the Areopagus, the highest court of Athens,
Apollo acting as his advocate, and she sitting as umpire in the midst.&nbsp;
The white and black balls are thrown into the urn, and are equal; and
Orestes is only delivered by the decision of Athen&eacute;&mdash;as
the representative of the nearer race of gods, the Olympians, the friends
of man, in whose likeness man is made.&nbsp; The Furies are the representatives
of the older and darker creed&mdash;which yet has a depth of truth in
it&mdash;of the irreversible dooms which underlie all nature; and which
represent the Law, and not the Gospel, the consequence of the mere act,
independent of the spirit which has prompted it.</p>
<p>They break out in fury against the overbearing arrogance of these
younger gods.&nbsp; Athen&eacute; bears their rage with equanimity,
addresses them in the language of kindness, even of veneration, till
these so indomitable beings are unable to withstand the charm of her
mild eloquence.&nbsp; They are to have a sanctuary in the Athenian land,
and to be called no more Furies (Erinnys), but Eumenides&mdash;the <i>well-conditioned</i>&mdash;the
kindly goddesses.&nbsp; And all ends with a solemn precession round
the orchestra, with hymns of blessing, while the terrible Chorus of
the Furies, clothed in black, with blood-stained girdles, and serpents
in their hair, in masks having perhaps somewhat of the terrific beauty
of Medusa-masks, are convoyed to their new sanctuary by a procession
of children, women, and old men in purple robes with torches in their
hands, after Athen&eacute; and the Furies have sung, in response to
each other, a chorus from which I must beg leave to give you an extract
or two:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p><i>Eldest Fury</i> (<i>Leader of the Chorus</i>).</p>
<p>Far from thy dwelling, and far from thy border,<br />By the grace
of my godhead benignant I order<br />The blight which may blacken the
bloom of the trees.<br />Far from thy border, and far from thy dwelling,<br />Be
the hot blast which shrivels the bud in its swelling,<br />The seed-rotting
taint, and the creeping disease.<br />Thy flocks be still doubled, thy
seasons be steady,<br />And when Hermes is near thee, thy hand be still
ready<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Heaven-dropt bounty to seize.</p>
<p><i>Athen&eacute;.</i></p>
<p>Hear her words, my city&rsquo;s warders&mdash;<br />Fraught with
blessings, she prevaileth<br />With Olympians and Infernals,<br />Dread
Erinnys much revered.<br />Mortal faith she guideth plainly<br />To
what goal she pleaseth, sending<br />Songs to some, to others days<br />With
tearful sorrows dulled.</p>
<p><i>Furies.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far from thy border<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
lawless disorder<br />That sateless of evil shall reign;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far
from thy dwelling,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dear blood welling,<br />That
taints thine own hearth with the slain.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When
slaughter from slaughter<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall flow like the
water,<br />And rancour from rancour shall grow<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But
joy with joy blending,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Live, each to all lending;<br />And
hating one-hearted the foe.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When bliss hath departed;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From
love single-hearted,<br />A fountain of healing shall flow.</p>
<p><i>Athen&eacute;</i>.</p>
<p>Wisely now the tongue of kindness<br />Thou hast found, the way of
love.<br />And these terror-speaking faces<br />Now look wealth to me
and mine.<br />Her so willing, ye more willing,<br />Now receive.&nbsp;
This land and city,<br />On ancient right securely throned,<br />Shall
shine for evermore.</p>
<p><i>Furies</i>.</p>
<p>Hail, and all hail, mighty people, be greeted,<br />On the sons of
Athena shines sunshine the clearest.<br />Blest people, near Jove the
Olympian seated.<br />And dear to the maiden his daughter the dearest.<br />Timely
wise &rsquo;neath the wings of the daughter ye gather,<br />And mildly
looks down on her children the Father.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Those of you here who love your country as well as the old Athenians
loved theirs, will feel at once the grand political significance of
such a scene, in which patriotism and religion become one&mdash;and
feel, too, the exquisite dramatic effect of the innocent, the weak,
the unwarlike, welcoming among them, without fear, because without guilt,
those ancient snaky-haired sisters, emblems of all that is most terrible
and most inscrutable, in the destiny of nations, of families, and of
men:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>To their hallowed habitations<br />&rsquo;Neath Ogygian earth&rsquo;s
foundations<br />In that darksome hall<br />Sacrifice and supplication<br />Shall
not fail.&nbsp; In adoration<br />Silent worship all.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Listen again, to the gentler patriotism of a gentler poet, Sophocles
himself.&nbsp; The village of Colonos, a mile from Athens, was his birthplace;
and in his &ldquo;&OElig;dipus Coloneus,&rdquo; he makes his Chorus
of village officials sing thus of their consecrated olive grove:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In good hap, stranger, to these rural seats<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou
comest, to this region&rsquo;s blest retreats,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where
white Colonos lifts his head,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And glories in
the bounding steed.<br />Where sadly sweet the frequent nightingale<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Impassioned
pours his evening song,<br />And charms with varied notes each verdant
vale,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ivy&rsquo;s dark-green boughs among,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or
sheltered &rsquo;neath the clustering vine<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which,
high above him forms a bower,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Safe from the sun
or stormy shower,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where frolic Bacchus often
roves,<br />And visits with his fostering nymphs the groves,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bathed
in the dew of heaven each morn,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fresh is the
fair Narcissus born,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of those great gods the
crown of old;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crocus glitters, robed in gold.<br />Here
restless fountains ever murmuring glide,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
as their crisp&egrave;d streamlets play,<br />To feed, Cephisus, thine
unfailing tide,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fresh verdure marks their winding
way.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here oft to raise the tuneful song<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
virgin band of Muses deigns,<br />And car-borne Aphrodite guides her
golden reins.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Then they go on, this band of village elders, to praise the gods
for their special gifts to that small Athenian land.&nbsp; They praise
Pallas Athen&eacute;, who gave their forefathers the olive; then Poseidon&mdash;Neptune,
as the Romans call him&mdash;who gave their forefathers the horse; and
something more&mdash;the ship&mdash;the horse of the sea, as they, like
the old Norse Vikings after them, delighted to call it</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Our highest vaunt is this&mdash;Thy grace,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poseidon,
we behold,<br />The ruling curb, embossed with gold,<br />Controls the
courser&rsquo;s managed pace,<br />Though loud, oh king, thy billows
roar,<br />Our strong hands grasp the labouring oar,<br />And while
the Nereids round it play,<br />Light cuts our bounding bark its way.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>What a combination of fine humanities!&nbsp; Dance and song, patriotism
and religion, so often parted among us, have flowed together into one
in these stately villagers; each a small farmer; each a trained soldier,
and probably a trained seaman also; each a self-governed citizen; and
each a cultured gentleman, if ever there were gentlemen on earth.</p>
<p>But what drama, doing, or action&mdash;for such is the meaning of
the word&mdash;is going on upon the stage, to be commented on by the
sympathising Chorus?</p>
<p>One drama, at least, was acted in Athens in that year&mdash;440 B.C.&mdash;which
you, I doubt not, know well&mdash;&ldquo;Antigone,&rdquo; that of Sophocles,
which Mendelssohn has resuscitated in our own generation, by setting
it to music, divine indeed, though very different from the music to
which it was set, probably by Sophocles himself, at its first, and for
aught we know, its only representation; for pieces had not then, as
now, a run of a hundred nights and more.&nbsp; The Athenian genius was
so fertile, and the Athenian audience so eager for novelty, that new
pieces were demanded, and were forthcoming, for each of the great festivals,
and if a piece was represented a second time it was usually after an
interval of some years.&nbsp; They did not, moreover, like the moderns,
run every night to some theatre or other, as a part of the day&rsquo;s
amusement.&nbsp; Tragedy, and even comedy, were serious subjects, calling
out, not a passing sigh, or passing laugh, but all the higher faculties
and emotions.&nbsp; And as serious subjects were to be expressed in
verse and music, which gave stateliness, doubtless, even to the richest
burlesques of Aristophanes, and lifted them out of mere street-buffoonery
into an ideal fairyland of the grotesque, how much more stateliness
must verse and music have added to their tragedy!&nbsp; And how much
have we lost, toward a true appreciation of their dramatic art, by losing
almost utterly not only the laws of their melody and harmony, but even
the true metric time of their odes!&mdash;music and metre, which must
have surely been as noble as their poetry, their sculpture, their architecture,
possessed by the same exquisite sense of form and of proportion.&nbsp;
One thing we can understand&mdash;how this musical form of the drama,
which still remains to us in lower shapes, in the oratorio, in the opera,
must have helped to raise their tragedies into that ideal sphere in
which they all, like the &ldquo;Antigone,&rdquo; live and move.&nbsp;
So ideal and yet so human; nay rather, truly ideal, because truly human.&nbsp;
The gods, the heroes, the kings, the princesses of Greek tragedy were
dear to the hearts of Greek republicans, not merely as the founders
of their states, not merely as the tutelary deities, many of them, of
their country: but as men and women like themselves, only more vast;
with mightier wills, mightier virtues, mightier sorrows, and often mightier
crimes; their inward free-will battling, as Schlegel has well seen,
against outward circumstance and overruling fate, as every man should
battle, unless he sink to be a brute.&nbsp; &ldquo;In tragedy,&rdquo;
says Schlegel&mdash;uttering thus a deep and momentous truth&mdash;&ldquo;the
gods themselves either come forward as the servants of destiny and mediate
executors of its decrees, or approve themselves godlike only by asserting
their liberty of action and entering upon the same struggles with fate
which man himself has to encounter.&rdquo;&nbsp; And I believe this,
that this Greek tragedy, with its godlike men and manlike gods, and
heroes who had become gods by the very vastness of their humanity, was
a preparation, and it may be a necessary preparation, for the true Christian
faith in a Son of Man, who is at once utterly human and utterly divine.&nbsp;
That man is made in the likeness of God&mdash;is the root idea, only
half-conscious, only half-expressed, but instinctive, without which
neither the Greek Tragedies nor the Homeric Poems, six hundred years
before them, could have been composed.&nbsp; Doubtless the idea that
man was like a god degenerated too often into the idea that the gods
were like men, and as wicked.&nbsp; But that travestie of a great truth
is not confined to those old Greeks.&nbsp; Some so-called Christian
theories&mdash;as I hold&mdash;have sinned in that direction as deeply
as the Athenians of old.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I say, that this long acquiescence in the conception of
godlike struggle, godlike daring, godlike suffering, godlike martyrdom;
the very conception which was so foreign to the mythologies of any other
race&mdash;save that of the Jews, and perhaps of our own Teutonic forefathers&mdash;did
prepare, must have prepared men to receive as most rational and probable,
as the satisfaction of their highest instincts, the idea of a Being
in whom all those partial rays culminated in clear, pure light; of a
Being at once utterly human and utterly divine; who by struggle, suffering,
self-sacrifice, without a parallel, achieved a victory over circumstance
and all the dark powers which beleaguer main without a parallel likewise.</p>
<p>Take, as an example, the figure which you know best&mdash;the figure
of Antigone herself&mdash;devoting herself to be entombed alive, for
the sake of love and duty.&nbsp; Love of a brother, which she can only
prove, alas! by burying his corpse.&nbsp; Duty to the dead, an instinct
depending on no written law, but springing out of the very depth of
those blind and yet sacred monitions which prove that the true man is
not an animal, but a spirit; fulfilling her holy purpose, unchecked
by fear, unswayed by her sisters&rsquo; entreaties.&nbsp; Hardening
her heart magnificently till her fate is sealed; and then after proving
her godlike courage, proving the tenderness of her womanhood by that
melodious wail over her own untimely death and the loss of marriage
joys, which some of you must know from the music of Mendelssohn, and
which the late Dean Milman has put into English thus:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Come, fellow-citizens, and see<br />The desolate Antigone.<br />On
the last path her steps shall treed,<br />Set forth, the journey of
the dead,<br />Watching, with vainly lingering gaze,<br />Her last,
last sun&rsquo;s expiring rays.</p>
<p>Never to see it, never more,<br />For down to Acheron&rsquo;s dread
shore,<br />A living victim am I led<br />To Hades&rsquo; universal
bed.<br />To my dark lot no bridal joys<br />Belong, nor o&rsquo;er
the jocund noise<br />Of hymeneal chant shall sound for me,<br />But
death, cold death, my only spouse shall be.</p>
<p>Oh tomb!&nbsp; Oh bridal chamber!&nbsp; Oh deep-delved<br />And strongly-guarded
mansion!&nbsp; I descend<br />To meet in your dread chambers all my
kindred,<br />Who in dark multitudes have crowded down<br />Where Proserpine
received the dead.&nbsp; But I,<br />The last&mdash;and oh how few more
miserable!&mdash;<br />Go down, or ere my sands of life are run.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>And let me ask you whether the contemplation of such a self-sacrifice
should draw you, should have drawn those who heard the tale nearer to,
or farther from, a certain cross which stood on Calvary some 1800 years
ago?&nbsp; May not the tale of Antigone heard from mother or from nurse
have nerved ere now some martyr-maiden to dare and suffer in an even
holier cause?</p>
<p>But to return.&nbsp; This set purpose of the Athenian dramatists
of the best school to set before men a magnified humanity, explains
much in their dramas which seems to us at first not only strange but
faulty.&nbsp; The masks which gave one grand but unvarying type of countenance
to each well-known historic personage, and thus excluded the play of
feature, animated gesture, and almost all which we now consider as &ldquo;acting&rdquo;
proper; the thick-soled cothurni which gave the actor a more than human
stature; the poverty (according to our notions) of the scenery, which
usually represented merely the front of a palace or other public place,
and was often though not always unchanged during the whole performance;
the total absence, in fact, of anything like that scenic illusion which
most managers of theatres seem now to consider as their highest achievement;
the small number of the actors, two, or at most three only, being present
on the stage at once,&mdash;the simplicity of the action, in which intrigue
(in the playhouse sense) and any complication of plot are utterly absent;
all this must have concentrated not the eye of the spectator on the
scene, but his ear upon the voice, and his emotions on the personages
who stood out before him without a background, sharp-cut and clear as
a group of statuary, which is the same, place it where you will, complete
in itself&mdash;a world of beauty, independent of all other things and
beings save on the ground on which it needs must stand.&nbsp; It was
the personage rather than his surroundings, which was to be impressed
by every word on the spectator&rsquo;s heart and intellect; and the
very essence of Greek tragedy is expressed in the still famous words
of Medea:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Che resta?&nbsp; Io.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Contrast this with the European drama&mdash;especially with the highest
form of it&mdash;our own Elizabethan.&nbsp; It resembles, as has been
often said in better words than mine, not statuary but painting.&nbsp;
These dramas affect colour, light, and shadow, background whether of
town or country, description of scenery where scenic machinery is inadequate,
all, in fact, which can blend the action and the actors with the surrounding
circumstances, without letting them altogether melt into the circumstances;
which can show them a part of the great whole, by harmony or discord
with the whole universe, down to the flowers beneath their feet.&nbsp;
This, too, had to be done: how it became possible for even the genius
of a Shakespeare to get it done, I may with your leave hint to you hereafter.&nbsp;
Why it was not given to the Greeks to do it, I know not.</p>
<p>Let us at least thank them for what they did.&nbsp; One work was
given them, and that one they fulfilled as it had never been fulfilled
before; as it will never need to be fulfilled again; for the Greeks&rsquo;
work was done not for themselves alone but for all races in all times;
and Greek Art is the heirloom of the whole human race; and that work
was to assert in drama, lyric, sculpture, music, gymnastic, the dignity
of man&mdash;the dignity of man which they perceived for the most part
with their intense &aelig;sthetic sense, through the beautiful in man.&nbsp;
Man with them was divine, inasmuch as he could perceive beauty and be
beautiful himself.&nbsp; Beauty might be physical, &aelig;sthetic, intellectual,
moral.&nbsp; But in proportion as a thing was perfect it revealed its
own perfection by its beauty.&nbsp; Goodness itself was a form&mdash;though
the highest form&mdash;of beauty.&nbsp; &Kappa;&alpha;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf;
meant both the physically beautiful and the morally good; &alpha;&iota;&sigma;&chi;&rho;&omicron;&sigmaf;
both the ugly and the bad.</p>
<p>Out of this root-idea sprang the whole of that Greek sculpture, which
is still, and perhaps ever will be, one of the unrivalled wonders of
the world.</p>
<p>Their first statues, remember, were statues of the gods.&nbsp; This
is an historic fact.&nbsp; Before B.C. 580 there were probably no statues
in Greece save those of deities.&nbsp; But of what form?&nbsp; We all
know that the usual tendency of man has been to represent his gods as
more or less monstrous.&nbsp; Their monstrosity may have been meant,
as it was certainly with the Mexican idols, and probably those of the
Semitic races of Syria and Palestine, to symbolise the ferocious passions
which they attributed to those objects of their dread, appeasable alone
by human sacrifice.&nbsp; Or the monstrosity, as with the hawk-headed
or cat-headed Egyptian idols, the winged bulls of Nineveh and Babylon,
the many-handed deities of Hindostan&mdash;merely symbolised powers
which could not, so the priest and the sculptor held, belong to mere
humanity.&nbsp; Now, of such monstrous forms of idols, the records in
Greece are very few and very ancient&mdash;relics of an older worship,
and most probably of an older race.&nbsp; From the earliest historic
period, the Greek was discerning more and more that the divine could
be best represented by the human; the tendency of his statuary was more
and more to honour that divine, by embodying it in the highest human
beauty.</p>
<p>In lonely mountain shrines there still might linger, feared and honoured,
dolls like those black virgins, of unknown antiquity, which still work
wonders on the European continent.&nbsp; In the mysterious cavern of
Phigalia, for instance, on the Eleatic shore of Peloponnese, there may
have been in remote times&mdash;so the legend ran&mdash;an old black
wooden image, a woman with a horse&rsquo;s head and mane, and serpents
growing round her head, who held a dolphin in one hand and a dove in
the other.&nbsp; And this image may have been connected with old nature-myths
about the marriage of Demeter and Poseidon&mdash;that is, of encroachments
of the sea upon the land; and the other myths of Demeter, the earth-mother,
may have clustered round the place, till the Phigalians were glad&mdash;for
it was profitable as well as honourable&mdash;to believe that in their
cavern Demeter sat mourning for the loss of Proserpine, whom Pluto had
carried down to Hades, and all the earth was barren till Zeus sent the
Fates, or Iris, to call her forth, and restore fertility to the world.&nbsp;
And it may be true&mdash;the legend as Pausanias tells it 600 years
after&mdash;that the old wooden idol having been burnt, and the worship
of Demeter neglected till a famine ensued, the Phigalians, warned by
the Oracle of Delphi, hired Onatas, a contemporary of Polygnotus and
Phidias, to make them a bronze replica of the old idol, from some old
copy and from a drama of his own.&nbsp; The story may be true.&nbsp;
When Pausanias went thither, in the second century after Christ, the
cave and the fountain, and the sacred grove of oaks, and the altar outside,
which was to be polluted with the blood of no victim&mdash;the only
offerings being fruits and honey, and undressed wool&mdash;were still
there.&nbsp; The statue was gone.&nbsp; Some said it had been destroyed
by the fall of the cliff; some were not sure that it had ever been there
at all.&nbsp; And meanwhile Praxiteles had already brought to perfection
(Paus. 1, 2, sec. 4) the ideal of Demeter, mother-like, as Her&eacute;&mdash;whom
we still call Juno now&mdash;but softer-featured, and her eyes more
closed.</p>
<p>And so for mother earth, as for the rest, the best representation
of the divine was the human.&nbsp; Now, conceive such an idea taking
hold, however slowly, of a people of rare physical beauty, of acutest
eye for proportion and grace, with opportunities of studying the human
figure such as exist nowhere now, save among tropic savages, and gifted,
moreover, in that as in all other matters, with that inmate diligence,
of which Mr. Carlyle has said, &ldquo;that genius is only an infinite
capacity of taking pains,&rdquo; and we can understand somewhat of the
causes which produced those statues, human and divine, which awe and
shame the artificiality and degeneracy of our modern so-called civilisation&mdash;we
can understand somewhat of the reverence for the human form, of the
careful study of every line, the storing up for use each scattered fragment
of beauty of which the artist caught sight, even in his daily walks,
and consecrating it in his memory to the service of him or her whom
he was trying to embody in marble or in bronze.&nbsp; And when the fashion
came in of making statues of victors in the games, and other distinguished
persons, a new element was introduced, which had large social as well
as artistic results.&nbsp; The sculptor carried his usual reverence
into his careful delineation of the victor&rsquo;s form, while he obtained
in him a model, usually of the very highest type, for perfecting his
idea of some divinity.&nbsp; The possibility of gaining the right to
a statue gave a fresh impulse to all competitors in the public games,
and through them to the gymnastic training throughout all the states
of Greece, which made the Greeks the most physically able and graceful,
as well as the most beautiful people known to the history of the human
race,&mdash;a people who, reverencing beauty, reverenced likewise grace
or acted beauty, so utterly and honestly, that nothing was too humble
for a free man to do, if it were not done awkwardly and ill.&nbsp; As
an instance, Sophocles himself&mdash;over and above his poetic genius,
one of the most cultivated gentlemen, as well as one of the most exquisite
musicians, dancers, and gymnasts, and one of the most just, pious, and
gentle of all Greece&mdash;could not, by reason of the weakness of his
voice, act in his own plays, as poets were wont to do, and had to perform
only the office of stage-manager.&nbsp; Twice he took part in the action,
once as the blind old Thamyris playing on the harp, and once in his
own lost tragedy, the &ldquo;Nausicaa.&rdquo;&nbsp; There in the scene
in which the Princess, as she does in Homer&rsquo;s &ldquo;Odyssey,&rdquo;
comes down to the sea-shore with her maidens to wash the household clothes,
and then to play at ball&mdash;Sophocles himself, a man then of middle
age, did the one thing he could do better than any there&mdash;and,
dressed in women&rsquo;s clothes, among the lads who represented the
maidens, played at ball before the Athenian people.</p>
<p>Just sixty years after the representation of the &ldquo;Antigone,&rdquo;
10,000 Greeks, far on the plains of Babylon, cut through the whole Persian
army, as the railway train cuts through a herd of buffalo, and then
losing all their generals by treacherous warfare, fought their way north
from Babylon to Trebizond on the Black Sea, under the guidance of a
young Athenian, a pupil of Socrates, who had never served in the army
before.&nbsp; The retreat of Xenophon and his 10,000 will remain for
ever as one of the grandest triumphs of civilisation over brute force:
but what made it possible?&nbsp; That these men, and their ancestors
before them, had been for at least 100 years in <i>training</i>, physical,
intellectual, and moral, which made their bodies and their minds able
to dare and suffer like those old heroes of whom their tragedy had taught
them, and whose spirits they still believed would help the valiant Greek.&nbsp;
And yet that feat, which looks to us so splendid, attracted, as far
as I am aware, no special admiration at the time.&nbsp; So was the cultivated
Greek expected to behave whenever he came in contact with the uncultivated
barbarian.</p>
<p>But from what had sprung in that little state, this exuberance of
splendid life, physical, &aelig;sthetic, intellectual, which made, and
will make the name of Athens and of the whole cluster of Greek republics
for ever admirable to civilised man?&nbsp; Had it sprung from long years
of peaceful prosperity?&nbsp; From infinite making of money and comfort,
according to the laws of so-called political economy, and the dictates
of enlightened selfishness?&nbsp; Not so.&nbsp; But rather out of terror
and agony, and all but utter ruin&mdash;and out of a magnificent want
of economy, and the divine daring and folly of self-sacrifice.</p>
<p>In Salamis across the strait a trophy stood, and round that trophy,
forty years before, Sophocles, the author of &ldquo;Antigone,&rdquo;
then sixteen years of age, the loveliest and most cultivated lad in
Athens, undraped like a faun, with lyre in hand, was leading the Chorus
of Athenian youths, and singing to Athen&eacute;, the tutelary goddess,
a hymn of triumph for a glorious victory&mdash;the very symbol of Greece
and Athens, springing up into a joyous second youth after invasion and
desolation, as the grass springs up after the prairie fire has passed.&nbsp;
But the fire had been terrible.&nbsp; It had burnt Athens at least,
down to the very roots.&nbsp; True, while Sophocles was dancing, Xerxes,
the great king of the East, foiled at Salamis, as his father Darius
had been foiled at Marathon ten years before, was fleeing back to Persia,
leaving his innumerable hosts of slaves and mercenaries to be destroyed
piecemeal, by land at Platea, by sea at Mycal&eacute;.&nbsp; The bold
hope was over, in which the Persian, ever since the days of Cyrus, had
indulged&mdash;that he, the despot of the East, should be the despot
of the West likewise.&nbsp; It seemed to them as possible, though not
as easy, to subdue the Aryan Greek, as it had been to subdue the Semite
and the Turanian, the Babylonian and the Syrian; to riffle his temples,
to destroy his idols, carry off his women and children as colonists
into distant lands, as they had been doing with all the nations of the
East.&nbsp; And they had succeeded with isolated colonies, isolated
islands of Greeks, and the shores of Asia Minor.&nbsp; But when they
dared, at last, to attack the Greek in his own sacred land of Hellas,
they found they had bearded a lion in his den.&nbsp; Nay rather&mdash;as
those old Greeks would have said&mdash;they had dared to attack Pallas
Athen&eacute;, the eldest daughter of Zeus&mdash;emblem of that serene
and pure divine wisdom, of whom Solomon sang of old: &ldquo;The Lord
possessed me in the beginning of His way, before His works of old.&nbsp;
When He prepared the heavens, I was there, when He appointed the foundation
of the earth, then was I by him, as one brought up with Him, and I was
daily His delight, rejoicing always before Him: rejoicing in the habitable
part of His earth; <i>and</i> my <i>delight was with the sons of men</i>&rdquo;&mdash;to
attack Athen&eacute; and her brother Apollo, Lord of light, and beauty,
and culture, and grace, and inspiration&mdash;to attack them, not in
the name of Ormuzd, nor of any other deity, but in the name of mere
brute force and lust of conquest.&nbsp; The old Persian spirit was gone
out of them.&nbsp; They were the symbols now of nothing save despotism
and self-will, wealth and self-indulgence.&nbsp; They, once the children
of Ormuzd or light, had become the children of Ahriman or darkness;
and therefore it was, as I believe, that Xerxes&rsquo; 1000 ships, and
the two million (or, as some have it, five million) human beings availed
naught against the little fleets and little battalions of men who believed
with a living belief in Athen&eacute; and Apollo, and therefore&mdash;ponder
it well, for it is true&mdash;with a living belief, under whatsoever
confusions and divisions of personality, in a God who loved, taught,
inspired men, a just God who befriended the righteous cause, the cause
of freedom and patriotism, a Deity, the echo of whose mind and will
to man was the song of Athen&eacute; on Olympus, when she</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Chanted of order and right, and of foresight, and order of peoples;<br />Chanted
of labour and craft, wealth in the port and the garner;<br />Chanted
of valour and fame, and the man who can fall with the foremost,<br />Fighting
for children and wife, and the field which his father bequeathed him.<br />Sweetly
and cunningly sang she, and planned new lessons for mortals.<br />Happy
who hearing obey her, the wise unsullied Athen&eacute;.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Ah, that they had always obeyed her, those old Greeks.&nbsp; But
meanwhile, as I said, the agony had been extreme.&nbsp; If Athens had
sinned, she had been purged as by fire; and the fire&mdash;surely of
God&mdash;had been terrible.&nbsp; Northern Greece had either been laid
waste with fire and sword, or had gone over to the Persian, traitors
in their despair.&nbsp; Attica, almost the only loyal state, had been
overrun; the old men, women, and children had fled to the neighbouring
islands, or to the Peloponnese.&nbsp; Athens itself had been destroyed;
and while young Sophocles was dancing round the trophy at Salamis, the
Acropolis was still a heap of blackened ruins.</p>
<p>But over and above their valour, over and above their loyalty, over
and above their exquisite &aelig;sthetic faculty, these Athenians had
a resilience of self-reliant energy, like that of the French&mdash;like
that of the American people after the fire of Chicago; and Athens rose
from her ashes to be awhile, not only, as she had nobly earned by suffering
and endurance, the leading state in Greece, but a mighty fortress, a
rich commercial port, a living centre of art, poetry, philosophy, such
as this earth has never seen before or since.</p>
<p>On the plateau of that little crag of the Acropolis some eight hundred
feet in length, by four hundred in breadth&mdash;about the size and
shape of the Castle Rock at Edinburgh&mdash;was gathered, within forty
years of the battle of Salamis, more and more noble beauty than ever
stood together on any other spot of like size.</p>
<p>The sudden relief from crushing pressure, and the joyous consciousness
of well-earned honours, made the whole spirit-nature of the people blossom
out, as it were, into manifold forms of activity, beauty, research,
and raised, in raising Greece, the whole human race thenceforth.</p>
<p>What might they not have done&mdash;looking at what they actually
did&mdash;for the whole race of man?</p>
<p>But no&mdash;they fell, even more rapidly than they rose, till their
grace and their cultivation, for them they could not lose, made them
the willing ministers to the luxury, the frivolity, the sentimentality,
the vice of the whole old world&mdash;the Scapia or Figaro of the old
world&mdash;infinitely able, but with all his ability consecrated to
the service of his own base self.&nbsp; The Greekling&mdash;as Juvenal
has it&mdash;in want of a dinner, would climb somehow to heaven itself,
at the bidding of his Roman master.</p>
<p>Ah what a fall!&nbsp; And what was the inherent weakness which caused
that fall?</p>
<p>I say at once&mdash;want of honesty.&nbsp; The Greek was not to be
depended on; if it suited him, he would lie, betray, overreach, change
sides, and think it no sin.&nbsp; He was the sharpest of men.&nbsp;
Sharp practice, in our modern sense of the word, was the very element
in which he floated.&nbsp; Any scholar knows it.&nbsp; In the grand
times of Marathon and Salamis, down to the disastrous times of the Peloponnesian
War and the thirty tyrants, no public man&rsquo;s hands were clean,
with the exception, perhaps, of Aristides, who was banished because
men were tired of hearing him called the Just.&nbsp; The exciting cause
of the Peloponnesian war, and the consequent downfall of Athens, was
not merely the tyranny she exercised over the states allied to her,
it was the sharp practice of the Athenians, in misappropriating the
tribute paid by the allies to the decoration of Athens.&nbsp; And in
laying the foundations of the Parthenon was sown, by a just judgment,
the seed of ruin for the state which gloried in it.&nbsp; And if the
rulers were such, what were the people?&nbsp; If the free were such,
what were the slaves?</p>
<p>Hence, weakness at home and abroad, mistrust of generals and admirals,
paralysing all bold and clear action, peculations and corruptions at
home, internecine wars between factions inside states, and between states
or groups of states, revolutions followed by despotism, and final exhaustion
and slavery&mdash;slavery to a people who were coming across the western
sea, hard-headed, hard-hearted, caring nothing for art, or science,
whose pleasures were coarse and cruel, but with a certain rough honesty,
reverence for country, for law, and for the ties of a family&mdash;men
of a somewhat old English type, who had over and above, like the English,
the inspiring belief that they could conquer the whole world, and who
very nearly succeeded in that&mdash;as we have, to our great blessing,
not succeeded&mdash;I mean, of course, the Romans.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>THOUGHTS ON SHELLEY AND BYRON <a name="citation35"></a><a href="#footnote35">{35}</a></h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>The poets, who forty years ago proclaimed their intention of working
a revolution in English literature, and who have succeeded in their
purpose, recommended especially a more simple and truthful view of nature.&nbsp;
The established canons of poetry were to be discarded as artificial;
as to the matter, the poet was to represent mere nature as he saw her;
as to form, he was to be his own law.&nbsp; Freedom and nature were
to be his watchwords.</p>
<p>No theory could be more in harmony with the spirit of the age, and
the impulse which had been given to it by the burning words of Jean
Jacques Rousseau.&nbsp; The school which arose expressed fairly the
unrest and unruliness of the time, its weariness of artificial restraint
and unmeaning laws, its craving after a nobler and a more earnest life,
its sense of a glory and mystery in the physical universe, hidden from
the poets of the two preceding centuries, and now revealed by science.&nbsp;
So far all was hopeful.&nbsp; But it soon became apparent, that each
poet&rsquo;s practical success in carrying out the theory was, paradoxically
enough, in inverse proportion to his belief in it; that those who like
Wordsworth, Southey, and Keats, talked most about naturalness and freedom,
and most openly reprobated the school of Pope, were, after all, least
natural and least free; that the balance of those excellences inclined
much more to those who, like Campbell, Rogers, Crabbe, and Moore, troubled
their heads with no theories, but followed the best old models which
they knew; and that the rightful sovereign of the new Parnassus, Lord
Byron, protested against the new movement, while he followed it; upheld
to the last the models which it was the fashion to decry, confessed
to the last, in poetry as in morals, &ldquo;Video meliora proboque,
deteriora sequor,&rdquo; and uttered again and again prophecies of the
downfall of English poetry and English taste, which seem to be on the
eve of realisation.</p>
<p>Now no one will, we presume, be silly enough to say that humanity
has gained nothing by all the very beautiful poetry which has been poured
out on it during the last thirty years in England.&nbsp; Nevertheless,
when we see poetry dying down among us year by year, although the age
is becoming year by year more marvellous and inspiring, we have a right
to look for some false principle in a school which has had so little
enduring vitality, which seems now to be able to perpetuate nothing
of itself but its vices.</p>
<p>The answer so easy twenty years ago, that the new poetry was spoiled
by an influx of German bad taste, will hardly hold good now, except
with a very few very ignorant people.&nbsp; It is now known, of course,
that whatsoever quarrel Lessing, Schiller, and Goethe may have had with
Pope, it was not on account of his being too severe an artist, but too
loose a one; not for being too classical, but not classical enough;
that English poets borrowed from them nothing but their most boyish
and immature types of thought, and that these were reproduced, and laughed
at here, while the men themselves were writing works of a purity, and
loftiness, and completeness, unknown to the world&mdash;except in the
writings of Milton&mdash;for nearly two centuries.&nbsp; This feature,
however, of the new German poetry, was exactly the one which no English
poet deigned to imitate, save Byron alone; on whom, accordingly, Goethe
always looked with admiration and affection.&nbsp; But the rest went
their way unheeding; and if they have defects, those defects are their
own; for when they did copy the German taste, they, for the most part,
deliberately chose the evil, and refused the good; and have their reward
in a fame which we believe will prove itself a very short-lived one.</p>
<p>We cannot deny, however, that, in spite of all faults, these men
had a strength.&nbsp; They have exercised an influence.&nbsp; And they
have done so by virtue of seeing a fact which more complete, and in
some cases more manly poets, did not see.&nbsp; Strangely enough, Shelley,
the man who was the greatest sinner of them all against the canons of
good taste, was the man who saw that new fact, if not most clearly,
still most intensely, and who proclaimed it most boldly.&nbsp; His influence,
therefore, is outliving that of his compeers, and growing and spreading,
for good and for evil; and will grow and spread for years to come, as
long as the present great unrest goes on smouldering in men&rsquo;s
hearts, till the hollow settlement of 1815 is burst asunder anew, and
men feel that they are no longer in the beginning of the end, but in
the end itself, and that this long thirty years&rsquo; prologue to the
reconstruction of rotten Europe is played out at last, and the drama
itself begun.</p>
<p>Such is the way of Providence; the race is not to the swift, nor
the battle to the strong, nor the prophecy to the wise.&nbsp; The Spirit
bloweth where He listeth, and sends on his errands&mdash;those who deny
Him, rebel against Him&mdash;profligates, madmen, and hysterical Rousseaus,
hysterical Shelleys, uttering words like the east wind.&nbsp; He uses
strange tools in His cosmogony: but He does not use them in vain.&nbsp;
By bad men if not by good, by fools if not by wise, God&rsquo;s work
is done, and done right well.</p>
<p>There was, then, a strength and a truth in all these men; and it
was this&mdash;that more or less clearly, they all felt that they were
standing between two worlds; and the ruins of an older age; upon the
threshold of a new one.&nbsp; To Byron&rsquo;s mind, the decay and rottenness
of the old was, perhaps, the most palpable; to Shelley&rsquo;s, the
possible glory of the new.&nbsp; Wordsworth declared&mdash;a little
too noisily, we think, as if he had been the first to discover the truth&mdash;the
dignity and divineness of the most simple human facts and relationships.&nbsp;
Coleridge declares that the new can only assume living form by growing
organically out of the old institutions.&nbsp; Keats gives a sad and
yet a wholesome answer to them both, as, young and passionate, he goes
down with Faust &ldquo;to the Mothers&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the rich warm youth of the nations,<br />Childlike
in virtue and faith, though childlike in passion and pleasure,<br />Childlike
still, still near to the gods, while the sunset of Eden<br />Lingered
in rose-red rays on the peaks of Ionian mountains.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>And there, amid the old classic forms, he cries: &ldquo;These things,
too, are eternal&mdash;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>A thing of beauty is a joy for ever.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>These, or things even fairer than they, must have their place in
the new world, if it is to be really a home for the human race.&rdquo;&nbsp;
So he sings, as best he can, the half-educated and consumptive stable-keeper&rsquo;s
son, from his prison-house of London brick, and in one mighty yearn
after that beauty from which he is debarred, breaks his young heart,
and dies, leaving a name not &ldquo;writ in water,&rdquo; as he dreamed,
but on all fair things, all lovers&rsquo; hearts, for evermore.</p>
<p>Here, then, to return, is the reason why the hearts of the present
generation have been influenced so mightily by these men, rather than
by those of whom Byron wrote, with perfect sincerity:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Scott, Rogers, Campbell, Moore, and Crabbe will try<br />&rsquo;Gainst
you the question with posterity.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>These lines, written in 1818, were meant to apply only to Coleridge,
Wordsworth, and Southey.&nbsp; Whether they be altogether just or unjust
is not now the question.&nbsp; It must seem somewhat strange to our
young poets that Shelley&rsquo;s name is not among those who are to
try the question of immortality against the Lake School; and yet many
of his most beautiful poems had been already written.&nbsp; Were, then,
&ldquo;The Revolt of Islam&rdquo; and &ldquo;Alastor&rdquo; not destined,
it seems, in Byron&rsquo;s opinion, to live as long as the &ldquo;Lady
of the Lake&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Mariners of England?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Perhaps not.&nbsp; At least the omission of Shelley&rsquo;s name is
noteworthy.&nbsp; But still more noteworthy are these words of his to
Mr. Murray, dated January 23, 1819:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Read Pope&mdash;most of you don&rsquo;t&mdash;but do . . .
and the inevitable consequence would be, that you would burn all that
I have ever written, and all your other wretched Claudians of the day
(except Scott and Crabbe) into the bargain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And here arises a new question&mdash;Is Shelley, then, among the
Claudians?&nbsp; It is a hard saying.&nbsp; The present generation will
receive it with shouts of laughter.&nbsp; Some future one, which studies
and imitates Shakespeare instead of anatomising him, and which gradually
awakens to the now forgotten fact, that a certain man named Edmund Spenser
once wrote a poem, the like of which the earth never saw before, and
perhaps may never see again, may be inclined to acquiesce in the verdict,
and believe that Byron had a discrimination in this matter, as in a
hundred more, far more acute than any of his compeers, and had not eaten
in vain, poor fellow, of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.&nbsp;
In the meanwhile, we may perceive in the poetry of the two men deep
and radical differences, indicating a spiritual difference between them
even more deep, which may explain the little notice which Byron takes
of Shelley&rsquo;s poetry, and the fact that the two men had no deep
sympathy for each other, and could not in any wise &ldquo;pull together&rdquo;
during the sojourn in Italy.&nbsp; Doubtless, there were plain outward
faults of temper and character on both sides; neither was in a state
of mind which could trust itself, or be trusted by those who loved them
best.&nbsp; Friendship can only consist with the calm and self-restraint
and self-respect of moral and intellectual health; and both were diseased,
fevered, ready to take offence, ready, unwittingly, to give it.&nbsp;
But the diseases of the two were different, as their natures were; and
Shelley&rsquo;s fever was not Byron&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Now it is worth remarking, that it is Shelley&rsquo;s form of fever,
rather than Byron&rsquo;s, which has been of late years the prevailing
epidemic.&nbsp; Since Shelley&rsquo;s poems have become known in England,
and a timid public, after approaching in fear and trembling the fountain
which was understood to be poisoned, has begun first to sip, and then,
finding the magic water at all events sweet enough, to quench its thirst
with unlimited draughts, Byron&rsquo;s fiercer wine has lost favour.&nbsp;
Well&mdash;at least the taste of the age is more refined, if that be
matter of congratulation.&nbsp; And there is an excuse for preferring
champagne to waterside porter, heady with grains of paradise and quassia,
salt and cocculus indicus.&nbsp; Nevertheless, worse ingredients than
&oelig;nanthic acid may lurk in the delicate draught, and the Devil&rsquo;s
Elixir may be made fragrant, and sweet, and transparent enough, as French
moralists well know, for the most fastidious palate.&nbsp; The private
sipping of eua-de-cologne, say the London physicians, has increased
mightily of late; and so has the reading of Shelley.&nbsp; It is not
surprising.&nbsp; Byron&rsquo;s Corsairs and Laras have been, on the
whole, impossible during the thirty years&rsquo; peace! and piracy and
profligacy are at all times, and especially nowadays, expensive amusements,
and often require a good private fortune&mdash;rare among poets.&nbsp;
They have, therefore, been wisely abandoned as ideals, except among
a few young persons, who used to wear turn-down collars, and are now
attempting moustaches and Mazzini hats.&nbsp; But even among them, and
among their betters&mdash;rather their more-respectables&mdash;nine-tenths
of the bad influence which is laid at Byron&rsquo;s door really is owing
to Shelley.&nbsp; Among the many good-going gentlemen and ladies, Byron
is generally spoken of with horror&mdash;he is &ldquo;so wicked,&rdquo;
forsooth; while poor Shelley, &ldquo;poor dear Shelley,&rdquo; is &ldquo;very
wrong, of course,&rdquo; but &ldquo;so refined,&rdquo; &ldquo;so beautiful,&rdquo;
&ldquo;so tender&rdquo;&mdash;a fallen angel, while Byron is a satyr
and a devil.&nbsp; We boldly deny the verdict.&nbsp; Neither of the
two are devils; as for angels, when we have seen one, we shall be better
able to give an opinion; at present, Shelley is in our eyes far less
like one of those old Hebrew and Miltonic angels, fallen or unfallen,
than Byron is.&nbsp; And as for the satyr; the less that is said for
Shelley, on that point, the better.&nbsp; If Byron sinned more desperately
and flagrantly than he, it was done under the temptations of rank, wealth,
disappointed love, and under the impulses of an animal nature, to which
Shelley&rsquo;s passions were</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>As moonlight unto sunlight, and as water unto wine.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>At all events, Byron never set to work to consecrate his own sin
into a religion and proclaim the worship of uncleanness as the last
and highest ethical development of &ldquo;pure&rdquo; humanity.&nbsp;
No&mdash;Byron may be brutal; but he never cants.&nbsp; If at moments
he finds himself in hell, he never turns round to the world and melodiously
informs them that it is heaven, if they could but see it in its true
light.</p>
<p>The truth is, that what has put Byron out of favour with the public
of late has been not his faults but his excellences.&nbsp; His artistic
good taste, his classical polish, his sound shrewd sense, his hatred
of cant, his insight into humbug above all, his shallow, pitiable habit
of being always intelligible&mdash;these are the sins which condemn
him in the eyes of a mesmerising, table-turning, spirit-rapping, spiritualising,
Romanising generation, who read Shelley in secret, and delight in his
bad taste, mysticism, extravagance, and vague and pompous sentimentalism.&nbsp;
The age is an effeminate one, and it can well afford to pardon the lewdness
of the gentle and sensitive vegetarian, while it has no mercy for that
of the sturdy peer proud of his bull neck and his boxing, who kept bears
and bull-dogs, drilled Greek ruffians at Missoloughi, and &ldquo;had
no objection to a pot of beer;&rdquo; and who might, if he had reformed,
have made a gallant English gentleman; while Shelley, if once his intense
self-opinion had deserted him, would have probably ended in Rome as
an Oratorian or a Passionist.</p>
<p>We would that it were only for this count that Byron has had to make
way for Shelley.&nbsp; There is, as we said before, a deeper moral difference
between the men, which makes the weaker, rather than the stronger, find
favour in young men&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; For Byron has the most intense
and awful sense of moral law&mdash;of law external to himself.&nbsp;
Shelley has little or none; less, perhaps, than any known writer who
has ever meddled with moral questions.&nbsp; Byron&rsquo;s cry is, I
am miserable because law exists; and I have broken it, broken it so
habitually, that now I cannot help breaking it.&nbsp; I have tried to
eradicate the sense of it by speculation, by action; but I cannot&mdash;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>The tree of knowledge is not the tree of life.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>There is a moral law independent of us, and yet the very marrow of
our life, which punishes and rewards us by no arbitrary external penalties,
but by our own consciousness of being what we are:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>The mind which is immortal, makes itself<br />Requital for its good
or evil thoughts;<br />Is its own origin of ill, and end&mdash;<br />And
its own place and time&mdash;its innate sense<br />When stript of this
mortality derives<br />No colour from the fleeting things about,<br />But
is absorbed in sufferance or in joy,<br />Born from the knowledge of
its own desert.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>This idea, confused, intermitted, obscured by all forms of evil&mdash;for
it was not discovered, but only in the process of discovery&mdash;is
the one which comes out with greater and greater strength, through all
Corsairs, Laras, and Parasinas, till it reaches its completion in &ldquo;Cain&rdquo;
and in &ldquo;Manfred,&rdquo; of both of which we do boldly say, that
if any sceptical poetry at all be right, which we often question, they
are right and not wrong; that in &ldquo;Cain,&rdquo; as in &ldquo;Manfred,&rdquo;
the awful problem which, perhaps, had better not have been put at all,
is nevertheless fairly put, and the solution, as far as it is seen,
fairly confessed; namely, that there is an absolute and eternal law
in the heart of man which sophistries of his own or of other beings
may make him forget, deny, blaspheme; but which exists eternally, and
will assert itself.&nbsp; If this be not the meaning of &ldquo;Manfred,&rdquo;
especially of that great scene in the chamois hunter&rsquo;s cottage,
what is?&mdash;If this be not the meaning of &ldquo;Cain,&rdquo; and
his awful awakening after the murder, not to any mere dread of external
punishment, but to an overwhelming, instinctive, inarticulate sense
of having done wrong, what is?</p>
<p>Yes; that law exists, let it never be forgotten, is the real meaning
of Byron, down to that last terrible &ldquo;Don Juan,&rdquo; in which
he sits himself down, in artificial calm, to trace the gradual rotting
and degradation of a man without law, the slave of his own pleasures;
a picture happily never finished, because he who painted it was taken
away before he had learnt, perhaps when he was beginning to turn back
from&mdash;the lower depth within the lowest deep.</p>
<p>Now to this whole form of consciousness, poor Shelley&rsquo;s mind
is altogether antipodal.&nbsp; His whole life through was a denial of
external law, and a substitution in its place of internal sentiment.&nbsp;
Byron&rsquo;s cry is: There is a law, and therefore I am miserable.&nbsp;
Why cannot I keep the law?&nbsp; Shelley&rsquo;s is: There is a law,
and therefore I am miserable.&nbsp; Why should not the law be abolished?&mdash;Away
with it, for it interferes with my sentiments&mdash;Away with marriage,
&ldquo;custom and faith, the foulest birth of time.&rdquo;&mdash;We
do not wish to follow him down into the fearful sins which he defended
with the small powers of reasoning&mdash;and they were peculiarly small&mdash;which
he possessed.&nbsp; Let any one who wishes to satisfy himself of the
real difference between Byron&rsquo;s mind and Shelley&rsquo;s, compare
the writings in which each of them treats the same subject&mdash;namely,
that frightful question about the relation of the sexes, which forms,
evidently, Manfred&rsquo;s crime; and see if the result is not simply
this, that Shelley glorifies what Byron damns.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lawless
love&rdquo; is Shelley&rsquo;s expressed ideal of the relation of the
sexes; and his justice, his benevolence, his pity, are all equally lawless.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Follow your instincts,&rdquo; is his one moral rule, confounding
the very lowest animal instincts with those lofty ideas of might, which
it was the will of Heaven that he should retain, ay, and love, to the
very last, and so reducing them all to the level of sentiments.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Follow your instincts&rdquo;&mdash;But what if our instincts
lead us to eat animal food?&nbsp; &ldquo;Then you must follow the instincts
of me, Percy Bysshe Shelley.&nbsp; I think it horrible, cruel; it offends
my taste.&rdquo;&nbsp; What if our instincts lead us to tyrannise over
our fellow-men?&nbsp; &ldquo;Then you must repress those instincts.&nbsp;
I, Shelley, think that, too, horrible and cruel.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whether
it be vegetarianism or liberty, the rule is practically the same&mdash;sentiment
which, in his case, as in the case of all sentimentalists, turns out
to mean at last, not the sentiments of mankind in general, but the private
sentiments of the writer.&nbsp; This is Shelley; a sentimentalist pure
and simple; incapable of anything like inductive reasoning; unable to
take cognisance of any facts but those which please his taste, or to
draw any conclusion from them but such as also pleases his taste; as,
for example, in that eighth stanza of the &ldquo;Ode to Liberty,&rdquo;
which, had it been written by any other man but Shelley, possessing
the same knowledge as he, one would have called a wicked and deliberate
lie&mdash;but in his case, is to be simply passed over with a sigh,
like a young lady&rsquo;s proofs of table-turning and rapping spirits.&nbsp;
She wished to see it so&mdash;and therefore so she saw it.</p>
<p>For Shelley&rsquo;s nature is utterly womanish.&nbsp; Not merely
his weak points, but his strong ones, are those of a woman.&nbsp; Tender
and pitiful as a woman; and yet, when angry, shrieking, railing, hysterical
as a woman.&nbsp; The physical distaste for meat and fermented liquors,
coupled with the hankering after physical horrors, are especially feminine.&nbsp;
The nature of a woman looks out of that wild, beautiful, girlish face&mdash;the
nature: but not the spirit; not</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>The reason firm, the temperate will,<br />Endurance, foresight, strength
and skill.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>The lawlessness of the man, with the sensibility of the woman. .
. .&nbsp; Alas for him!&nbsp; He, too, might have discovered what Byron
did; for were not his errors avenged upon him within, more terribly
even than without?&nbsp; His cries are like the wails of a child, inarticulate,
peevish, irrational; and yet his pain fills his whole being, blackens
the very face of nature to him: but he will not confess himself in the
wrong.&nbsp; Once only, if we recollect rightly, the truth flashes across
him for a moment, and the clouds of selfish sorrow:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Alas, I have nor hope nor health,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor peace
within, nor calm around;<br />Nor that content surpassing wealth<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
sage in meditation found,<br />And walked with inward glory crowned.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;Nor&rdquo;&mdash;alas for the spiritual bathos, which follows
that short gleam of healthy feeling, and coming to himself&mdash;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;fame nor power, nor love, nor leisure,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others
I see whom these surround,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smiling they live
and call life pleasure,<br />To me that cup has been dealt in another
measure!</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Poor Shelley!&nbsp; As if the peace within, and the calm around,
and the content surpassing wealth, were things which were to be put
in the same category with fame, and power, and love, and leisure.&nbsp;
As if they were things which could be &ldquo;dealt&rdquo; to any man;
instead of depending (as Byron, who, amid all his fearful sins, was
a man, knew well enough) upon a man&rsquo;s self, a man&rsquo;s own
will, and that will exerted to do a will exterior to itself, to know
and to obey a law.&nbsp; But no, the cloud of sentiment must close over
again, and</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Yet now despair itself is mild<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even as the
winds and waters are;<br />I could lie down like a tired child,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
weep away this life of care,<br />Which I have borne, and still must
bear,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till death like sleep might seize on me,<br />And
I might feel in the warm air,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My cheek grow cold,
and hear the sea<br />Breathe o&rsquo;er my dying brain its last monotony!</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Too beautiful to laugh at, however empty and sentimental.&nbsp; True:
but why beautiful?&nbsp; Because there is a certain sincerity in it,
which breeds coherence and melody, which, in short, makes it poetry.&nbsp;
But what if such a tone of mind be consciously encouraged, even insincerely
affected as the ideal state for a poet&rsquo;s mind, as his followers
have done?</p>
<p>The mischief which such a man would do is conceivable enough.&nbsp;
He stands out, both by his excellences and his defects, as the spokesman
and ideal of all the unrest and unhealth of sensitive young men for
many a year after.&nbsp; His unfulfilled prophecies only help to increase
that unrest.&nbsp; Who shall blame either him for uttering those prophecies,
or them for longing for their fulfilment?&nbsp; Must we not thank the
man who gives us fresh hope that this earth will not be always as it
is now?&nbsp; His notion of what it will be may be, as Shelley&rsquo;s
was, vague, even in some things wrong and undesirable.&nbsp; Still,
we must accept his hope and faith in the spirit, not in the letter.&nbsp;
So have thousands of young men felt, who would have shrunk with disgust
from some of poor Shelley&rsquo;s details of the &ldquo;good time coming.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And shame on him who should wish to rob them of such a hope, even if
it interfered with his favourite &ldquo;scheme of unfulfilled prophecy.&rdquo;&nbsp;
So men have felt Shelley&rsquo;s spell a wondrous one&mdash;perhaps,
they think, a life-giving regenerative one.&nbsp; And yet what dream
at once more shallow and more impossible?&nbsp; Get rid of kings and
priests; marriage may stay, pending discussions on the rights of women.&nbsp;
Let the poet speak&mdash;what he is to say being, of course, a matter
of utterly secondary import, provided only that he be a poet; and then
the millennium will appear of itself, and the devil be exorcised with
a kiss from all hearts&mdash;except, of course, these of &ldquo;pale
priests&rdquo; and &ldquo;tyrants with their sneer of cold command&rdquo;
(who, it seems, have not been got rid of after all), and the Cossacks
and Croats whom they may choose to call to their rescue.&nbsp; And on
the appearance of the said Cossacks and Croats, the poet&rsquo;s vision
stops short, and all is blank beyond.&nbsp; A recipe for the production
of millenniums which has this one advantage, that it is small enough
to be comprehended by the very smallest minds, and reproduced thereby,
with a difference, in such spasmodic melodies as seem to those small
minds to be imitations of Shelley&rsquo;s nightingale notes.</p>
<p>For nightingale notes they truly are.&nbsp; In spite of all his faults&mdash;and
there are few poetic faults in which he does not indulge, to their very
highest power&mdash;in spite of his &ldquo;interfluous&rdquo; and &ldquo;innumerous,&rdquo;
and the rest of his bad English&mdash;in spite of bombast, horrors,
maundering, sheer stuff and nonsense of all kinds, there is a plaintive
natural melody about this man, such as no other English poet has ever
uttered, except Shakespeare in some few immortal songs.&nbsp; Who that
has read Shelley does not recollect scraps worthy to stand by Ariel&rsquo;s
song&mdash;chaste, simple, unutterably musical?&nbsp; Yes, when he will
be himself&mdash;Shelley the scholar and the gentleman and the singer&mdash;and
leave philosophy and politics, which he does not understand, and shriekings
and cursings, which are unfit for any civilised and self-respecting
man, he is perfect.&nbsp; Like the American mocking-bird, he is harsh
only when aping other men&rsquo;s tunes&mdash;his true power lies in
his own &ldquo;native wood-notes wild.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it is not this faculty of his which has been imitated by his
scholars; for it is not this faculty which made him their ideal, however
it may have attracted them.&nbsp; All which sensible men deplore in
him is that which poetasters have exalted in him.&nbsp; His morbidity
and his doubt have become in their eyes his differential energy, because
too often, it was all in him with which they had wit to sympathise.&nbsp;
They found it easy to curse and complain, instead of helping to mend.&nbsp;
So had he.&nbsp; They found it pleasant to confound institutions with
the abuses which defaced them.&nbsp; So had he.&nbsp; They found it
pleasant to give way to their spleen.&nbsp; So had he.&nbsp; They found
it pleasant to believe that the poet was to regenerate the world, without
having settled with what he was to regenerate it.&nbsp; So had he.&nbsp;
They found it more pleasant to obey sentiment than inductive laws.&nbsp;
So had he.&nbsp; They found it more pleasant to hurl about enormous
words and startling figures than to examine reverently the awful depths
of beauty which lie in the simplest words and the severest figures.&nbsp;
So had he.</p>
<p>And thus arose a spasmodic, vague, extravagant, effeminate, school
of poetry, which has been too often hastily and unfairly fathered upon
Byron.&nbsp; Doubtless Byron has helped to its formation; but only in
as far as his poems possess, or rather seem to possess, elements in
common with Shelley&rsquo;s.&nbsp; For that conscious struggle against
law, by which law is discovered, may easily enough be confounded with
the utter repudiation of it.&nbsp; Both forms of mind will discuss the
same questions; both will discuss them freely, with a certain plainness
and daring, which may range through all grades, from the bluntness of
Socrates down to reckless immodesty and profaneness.&nbsp; The world
will hardly distinguish between the two; it did not in Socrates&rsquo;
case, mistaking his reverent irreverence for Atheism, and martyred him
accordingly, as it has since martyred Luther&rsquo;s memory.&nbsp; Probably,
too, if a living struggle is going on in the writer&rsquo;s mind, he
will not have distinguished the two elements in himself; he will be
profane when he fancies himself only arguing for truth; he will be only
arguing for truth, where he seems to the respectable undoubting to be
profane.&nbsp; And in the meanwhile, whether the respectable understand
him or not, the young and the inquiring, much more the distempered,
who would be glad to throw off moral law, will sympathise with him often
more than he sympathises with himself.&nbsp; Words thrown off in the
heat of passion; shameful self-revealings which he has written with
his very heart&rsquo;s blood: ay, even fallacies which he has put into
the mouths of dramatic characters for the very purpose of refuting them,
or at least of calling on all who read to help him to refute them, and
to deliver him from the ugly dream&mdash;all these will, by the lazy,
the frivolous, the feverish, the discontented, be taken for integral
parts and noble traits of the man to whom they are attracted, by finding
that he, too, has the same doubts and struggles as themselves, that
he has a voice and art to be their spokesman.&nbsp; And hence arises
confusion on confusion, misconception on misconception.&nbsp; The man
is honoured for his dishonour.&nbsp; Chronic disease is taken for a
new type of health; and Byron is admired and imitated for that which
Byron is trying to tear out of his own heart, and trample under foot
as his curse and bane, something which is not Byron&rsquo;s self, but
Byron&rsquo;s house-fiend, and tyrant, and shame.&nbsp; And in the meanwhile
that which calls itself respectability and orthodoxy, and is&mdash;unless
Augustine lied&mdash;neither of them, stands by; and instead of echoing
the voice of Him who said: &ldquo;Come to me ye that are weary and heavy
laden, and I will give you rest,&rdquo; mumbles proudly to itself, with
the Pharisees of old: &ldquo;This people, which knoweth not the law,
is accursed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We do not seek to excuse Byron any more than we do Shelley.&nbsp;
They both sinned.&nbsp; They both paid bitter penalty for their sin.&nbsp;
How far they were guilty, or which of them was the more guilty, we know
not.&nbsp; We can judge no man.&nbsp; It is as poets and teachers, not
as men and responsible spirits; not in their inward beings, known only
to Him who made them, not even to themselves, but in their outward utterance,
that we have a right to compare them.&nbsp; Both have done harm.&nbsp;
Neither have, we firmly believe, harmed any human being who had not
already the harm within himself.&nbsp; It is not by introducing evil,
but by calling into consciousness and more active life evil which was
already lurking in the heart, that any writer makes men worse.&nbsp;
Thousands doubtless have read Byron and Shelley, and worse books, and
have risen from them as pure as when they sat down.&nbsp; In evil as
well as in good, the eye only sees that which it brings with it the
power of seeing&mdash;say rather, the wish to see.&nbsp; But it is because,
in spite of all our self-glorifying p&aelig;ans, our taste has become
worse and not better, that Shelley, the man who conceitedly despises
and denies law, is taking the place of Byron, the man who only struggles
against it, and who shows his honesty and his greatness most by confessing
that his struggles are ineffectual; that, Titan as he may look to the
world, his strength is misdirected, a mere furious weakness, which proclaims
him a slave in fetters, while prurient young gentlemen are fancying
him heaping hills on hills, and scaling Olympus itself.&nbsp; They are
tired of that notion, however, now.&nbsp; They have begun to suspect
that Byron did not scale Olympus after all.&nbsp; How much more pleasant
a leader, then, must Shelley be, who unquestionably did scale his little
Olympus&mdash;having made it himself first to fit his own stature.&nbsp;
The man who has built the hay-rick will doubtless climb it again, if
need be, as often as desired, and whistle on the top, after the fashion
of the rick-building guild, triumphantly enough.&nbsp; For after all
Shelley&rsquo;s range of vision is very narrow, his subjects few, his
reflections still fewer, when compared, not only with such a poet as
Spenser, but with his own contemporaries; above all with Byron.&nbsp;
He has a deep heart, but not a wide one; an intense eye, but not a catholic
one.&nbsp; And, therefore, he never wrote a real drama; for in spite
of all that has been said to the contrary, Beatrice Cenci is really
none other than Percy Bysshe Shelley himself in petticoats.</p>
<p>But we will let them both be.&nbsp; Perhaps they know better now.</p>
<p>One very ugly superstition, nevertheless, we must mention, of which
these two men have been, in England at least, the great hierophants;
namely, the right of &ldquo;genius&rdquo; to be &ldquo;eccentric.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Doubtless there are excuses for such a notion; but it is one against
which every wise man must set his face like a flint; and at the risk
of being called a &ldquo;Philister&rdquo; and a &ldquo;flunky,&rdquo;
take part boldly with respectability and this wicked world, and declare
them to be for once utterly in the right.&nbsp; Still there are excuses
for it.&nbsp; A poet, especially one who wishes to be not merely a describer
of pretty things, but a &ldquo;Vates&rdquo; and seer of new truth, must
often say things which other people do not like to say, and do things
which others do not like to do.&nbsp; And, moreover, he will be generally
gifted, for the very purpose of enabling him to say and do these strange
things, with a sensibility more delicate than common, often painful
enough to himself.&nbsp; How easy for such a man to think that he has
a right not to be as other men are; to despise little conventionalities,
courtesies, even decencies; to offend boldly and carelessly, conscious
that he has something right and valuable within himself which not only
atones for such defects, but allows him to indulge in them, as badges
of his own superiority!&nbsp; This has been the notion of artistic genius
which has spread among us of late years, just in proportion as the real
amount of artistic genius has diminished; till we see men, on the mere
ground of being literary men, too refined to keep accounts, or pay their
butchers&rsquo; bills; affecting the pettiest absurdities in dress,
in manner, in food; giving themselves credit for being unable to bear
a noise, keep their temper, educate their own children, associate with
their fellow-men; and a thousand other paltry weaknesses, morosenesses,
self-indulgences, fastidiousnesses, vulgarities&mdash;for all this is
essentially vulgar, and demands, not honour and sympathy, but a chapter
in Mr. Thackeray&rsquo;s &ldquo;Book of Snobs.&rdquo;&nbsp; Non sic
itur ad astra.&nbsp; Self-indulgence and exclusiveness can only be a
proof of weakness.&nbsp; It may accompany talent, but it proves that
talent to be partial and defective.&nbsp; The brain may be large, but
the manhood, the &ldquo;virtus,&rdquo; is small, where such things are
allowed, much more where they are gloried in.&nbsp; A poet such a man
may be, but a world poet never.&nbsp; He is sectarian, a poetical Quaker,
a Puritan, who, forgetting that the truth which he possesses is equally
the right and inheritance of every man he meets, takes up a peculiar
dress or phraseology, as symbols of his fancied difference from his
human brothers.&nbsp; All great poets, till Shelley and Byron, as far
as we can discern, have been men especially free from eccentricities;
careful not merely of the chivalries and the respectabilities, but also
of the courtesies and the petty conventionalities, of the age in which
they lived; altogether well-bred men of the world.&nbsp; The answer,
that they learnt the ways of courts, does not avail; for if they had
had no innate good-breeding, reticence, respect for forms and customs,
they would never have come near courts at all.&nbsp; It is not a question
of rank and fashion, but of good feeling, common sense, unselfishness.&nbsp;
Goethe, Milton, Spenser, Shakespeare, Rabelais, Ariosto, were none of
them high-born men; several of them low-born; who only rose to the society
of high-horn men because they were themselves innately high-bred, polished,
complete, without exaggerations, affectations, deformities, weaknesses
of mind and taste, whatever may have been their weaknesses on certain
points of morals.&nbsp; The man of all men most bepraised by the present
generation of poets, is perhaps Wolfgang von Goethe.&nbsp; Why is it,
then, that of all men he is the one whom they strive to be most unlike?</p>
<p>And if this be good counsel for the man who merely wishes&mdash;and
no blame to him&mdash;to sing about beautiful things in a beautiful
way, it applies with tenfold force to the poet who desires honestly
to proclaim great truths.&nbsp; If he has to offend the prejudices of
the world in important things, that is all the more reason for his bowing
to those prejudices in little things, and being content to be like his
neighbours in outward matters, in order that he may make them like himself
in inward ones.&nbsp; Shall such a man dare to hinder his own message,
to drive away the very hearers to whom he believes himself to be sent,
for the sake of his own nerves, laziness, antipathies, much more of
his own vanity and pride?&nbsp; If he does so, he is unfaithful to that
very genius on which he prides himself.&nbsp; He denies its divinity,
by treating it as his own possession, to be displayed or hidden as he
chooses, for his own enjoyment, his own self-glorification.&nbsp; Well
for such a man if a day comes to him in which he will look back with
shame and self-reproach, not merely on every scandal which he may have
caused by breaking the moral and social laws of humanity, by neglecting
to restrain his appetites, pay his bills, and keep his engagements;
but also on every conceited word and look, every gaucherie and rudeness,
every self-indulgent moroseness and fastidiousness, as sins against
the sacred charge which has been committed to him; and determine with
that Jew of old, who, to judge from his letter to Philemon, was one
of the most perfect gentlemen of God&rsquo;s making who ever walked
this earth, to become &ldquo;all things to all men, if by any means
he may save some.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>ALEXANDER SMITH AND ALEXANDER POPE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>On reading this little book, <a name="citation61"></a><a href="#footnote61">{61}</a>
and considering all the exaggerated praise and exaggerated blame which
have been lavished on it, we could not help falling into many thoughts
about the history of English poetry for the last forty years, and about
its future destiny.&nbsp; Great poets, even true poets, are becoming
more and more rare among us.&nbsp; There are those even who say that
we have none; an assertion which, as long as Mr. Tennyson lives, we
shall take the liberty of denying.&nbsp; But were he, which Heaven forbid,
taken from us, whom have we to succeed him?&nbsp; And he, too, is rather
a poet of the sunset than of the dawn&mdash;of the autumn than of the
spring.&nbsp; His gorgeousness is that of the solemn and fading year;
not of its youth, full of hope, freshness, gay and unconscious life.&nbsp;
Like some stately hollyhock or dahlia of this month&rsquo;s gardens,
he endures while all other flowers are dying; but all around is winter&mdash;a
mild one, perhaps, wherein a few annuals or pretty field weeds still
linger on; but, like all mild winters, especially prolific in fungi,
which, too, are not without their gaudiness, even their beauty, although
bred only from the decay of higher organisms, the plagiarists of the
vegetable world.&nbsp; Such is poetry in England; while in America the
case is not much better.&nbsp; What more enormous scope for new poetic
thought than that which the New World gives?&nbsp; Yet the American
poets, even the best of them, look lingeringly and longingly back to
Europe and her legends; to her models, and not to the best of them&mdash;to
her criticism, and not to the best of that&mdash;and bestow but a very
small portion of such genius as they have on America and her new forms
of life.&nbsp; If they be nearer to the spring than we, they are still
deep enough in the winter.&nbsp; A few early flowers may be budding
among them, but the autumn crop is still in somewhat shabby and rain-bedrabbled
bloom.&nbsp; And for us, where are our spring flowers?&nbsp; What sign
of a new poetic school?&nbsp; Still more, what sign of the healthy resuscitation
of any old one?</p>
<p>&ldquo;What matter, after all?&rdquo; one says to oneself in despair,
re-echoing Mr. Carlyle.&nbsp; &ldquo;Man was not sent into the world
to write poetry.&nbsp; What we want is truth.&nbsp; Of the former we
have enough in all conscience just now.&nbsp; Let the latter need be
provided for by honest and righteous history, and as for poets, let
the dead bury their dead.&rdquo;&nbsp; And yet, after all, man will
write poetry, in spite of Mr. Carlyle: nay, beings who are not men,
but mere forked radishes, will write it.&nbsp; Man is a poetry-writing
animal.&nbsp; Perhaps he was meant to be one.&nbsp; At all events, he
can no more be kept from it than from eating.&nbsp; It is better, with
Mr. Carlyle&rsquo;s leave, to believe that the existence of poetry indicates
some universal human hunger, whether after &ldquo;the beautiful,&rdquo;
or after &ldquo;fame,&rdquo; or after the means of paying butchers&rsquo;
bills; and accepting it as a necessary evil which must be committed,
to see that it be committed as well, or at least as little ill, as possible.&nbsp;
In excuse of which we may quote Mr. Carlyle against himself, reminding
him of a saying of Goethe once bepraised by him in print: &ldquo;We
must take care of the beautiful, for the useful will take care of itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And never, certainly, since Pope wrote his Dunciad, did the beautiful
require more taking care of, or evince less capacity for taking care
of itself; and never, we must add, was less capacity for taking care
of it evinced by its accredited guardians of the press than at this
present time, if the reception given to Mr. Smith&rsquo;s poems is to
be taken as a fair expression of &ldquo;the public taste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, let it be fairly understood, Mr. Alexander Smith is not the
object of our reproaches: but Mr. Alexander Smith&rsquo;s models and
flatterers.&nbsp; Against him we have nothing whatsoever to say; for
him, very much indeed.</p>
<p>Very young, as is said, self-educated, drudging for his daily bread
in some dreary Glasgow prison-house of brick and mortar, he has seen
the sky, the sun and moon&mdash;and, moreover, the sea, report says,
for one day in his whole life; and this is nearly the whole of his experience
in natural objects.&nbsp; And he has felt, too painfully for his peace
of mind, the contrast between his environment and that of others&mdash;his
means of culture and that of others&mdash;and, still more painfully,
the contrast between his environment and culture, and that sense of
beauty and power of melody which he does not deny that he has found
in himself, and which no one can deny who reads his poems fairly; who
reads even merely the opening page and key-note of the whole:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>For as a torrid sunset burns with gold<br />Up to the zenith, fierce
within my soul<br />A passion burns from basement unto cope.<br />Poesy,
poesy, I&rsquo;d give to thee<br />As passionately my rich laden years,<br />My
bubble pleasures, and my awful joys,<br /><i>As Hero gave her trembling
sighs to find<br />Delicious death on wet Leander&rsquo;s lip.<br /></i>Bare,
bald, and tawdry, as a fingered moth<br />Is my poor life; but with
one smile thou canst<br />Clothe me with kingdoms.&nbsp; Wilt thou smile
on me?<br />Wilt bid me die for thee?&nbsp; Oh fair and cold!<br />As
well may some wild maiden waste her love<br />Upon the calm front of
a marble Jove.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Now this scrap is by no menus a fair average specimen of Mr. Smith&rsquo;s
verse.&nbsp; But is not the self-educated man who could teach himself,
amid Glasgow smoke and noise, to write such a distich as that exquisite
one which we have given in italics, to be judged lovingly and hopefully?</p>
<p>What if he has often copied?&nbsp; What if, in this very scrap, chosen
almost at random, there should be a touch from Tennyson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Two
Voices?&rdquo;&nbsp; And what if imitations, nay, caricatures, be found
in almost every page?&nbsp; Is not the explanation simple enough, and
rather creditable than discreditable to Mr. Smith?&nbsp; He takes as
his models Shelley, Keats, and their followers.&nbsp; Who is to blame
for that?&nbsp; The Glasgow youth, or the public taste, which has been
exalting these authors more and more for the last twenty years as the
great poets of the nineteenth century?&nbsp; If they are the proper
ideals of the day, who will blame him for following them as closely
as possible&mdash;for saturating his memory so thoroughly with their
words and thoughts that he reproduces them unconsciously to himself?&nbsp;
Who will blame him for even consciously copying their images, if they
have said better than he the thing which he wants to say, in the only
poetical dialect which he knows?&nbsp; He does no more than all schools
have done, copy their own masters; as the Greek epicists and Virgil
copied Homer; as all succeeding Latin epicists copied Virgil; as Italians
copied Ariosto and Tasso; as every one who can copies Shakespeare; as
the French school copied, or thought they copied, &ldquo;The Classics,&rdquo;
and as a matter of duty used to justify any bold image in their notes,
not by its originality, but by its being already in Claudian, or Lucan,
or Virgil, or Ovid; as every poetaster, and a great many who were more
than poetasters, twenty years ago, used to copy Scott and Byron, and
as all poetasters now are copying the very same models as Mr. Smith,
and failing while he succeeds.</p>
<p>We by no means agree in the modern outcry for &ldquo;originality.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Is it absolutely demanded that no poet shall say anything whatsoever
that any other poet has said?&nbsp; If so, Mr. Smith may well submit
to a blame which he will bear in common with Shakespeare, Chaucer, Pope,
and many another great name; and especially with Raphael himself, who
made no scruple of adopting not merely points of style, but single motives
and incidents, from contemporaries and predecessors.&nbsp; Who can look
at any of his earlier pictures, the Crucifixion for instance, at present
in Lord Ward&rsquo;s gallery at the Egyptian Hall, without seeing that
he has not merely felt the influence of Perugino, but copied him; tried
deliberately to be as like his master as he could?&nbsp; Was this plagiarism?&nbsp;
If so, all education, it would seem, must be a mere training in plagiarism.&nbsp;
For how is the student to learn, except by copying his master&rsquo;s
models?&nbsp; Is the young painter or sculptor a plagiarist because
he spends the first, often the best, years of his life in copying Greek
statues; or the schoolboy, for toiling at the reproduction of Latin
metres and images, in what are honestly and fittingly called &ldquo;copies&rdquo;
of verses.&nbsp; And what if the young artist shall choose, as Mr. Smith
has done, to put a few drawings into the exhibition, or to carve and
sell a few statuettes?&nbsp; What if the schoolboy, grown into a gownsman,
shall contribute his share to a set of &ldquo;Arundines Cami&rdquo;
or &ldquo;Prolusiones Etonienses?&rdquo;&nbsp; Will any one who really
knows what art or education means complain of them for having imitated
their models, however servilely?&nbsp; Will he not rather hail such
an imitation as a fair proof, first of the student&rsquo;s reverence
for authority&mdash;a more important element of &ldquo;genius&rdquo;
than most young folks fancy&mdash;and next, of his possessing any artistic
power whatsoever?&nbsp; For, surely, if the greater contains the less,
the power of creating must contain that of imitating.&nbsp; A young
author&rsquo;s power of accurate imitation is, after all, the primary
and indispensable test of his having even the capability of becoming
a poet.&nbsp; He who cannot write in a style which he does know, will
certainly not be able to invent a new style for himself.&nbsp; The first
and simplest form in which any metrical ear, or fancy, or imagination,
can show itself, must needs be in imitating existing models.&nbsp; Innate
good taste&mdash;that is, true poetic genius&mdash;will of course choose
the best models in the long run.&nbsp; But not necessarily at first.&nbsp;
What shall be the student&rsquo;s earliest ideal must needs be determined
for him by circumstance, by the books to which he has access, by the
public opinion which he hears expressed.&nbsp; Enough if he chooses,
as Raphael did, the best models which he knows, and tries to exhaust
them, and learn all he can from them, ready to quit them hereafter when
he comes across better ones, yet without throwing away what he has learnt.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Be faithful in a few things, and thou shalt become ruler over
many things,&rdquo; is one of those eternal moral laws which, like many
others, holds as true of art as it does of virtue.</p>
<p>And on the whole, judging Mr. Alexander Smith by this rule, he has
been faithful over a few things, and therefore we have fair hope of
him for the future.&nbsp; For Mr. Smith does succeed, not in copying
one poet, but in copying all, and very often in improving on his models.&nbsp;
Of the many conceits which he has borrowed from Mr. Bailey, there is
hardly one which he has not made more true, more pointed and more sweet;
nay, in one or two places, he has dared to mend John Keats himself.&nbsp;
But his whole merit is by no means confined to the faculty of imitation.&nbsp;
Though the &ldquo;Life Drama&rdquo; itself is the merest cento of reflections
and images, without coherence or organisation, dramatic or logical,
yet single scenes, like that with the peasant and that with the fallen
outcast, have firm self-consistency and clearness of conception; and
these, as a natural consequence, are comparatively free from those tawdry
spangles which deface the greater part of the poem.&nbsp; And, moreover,
in the episode of &ldquo;The Indian and the Lady,&rdquo; there is throughout
a &ldquo;keeping in the tone,&rdquo; as painters say, sultry and languid,
yet rich and full of life, like a gorgeous Venetian picture, which augurs
even better for Mr. Smith&rsquo;s future success than the two scenes
just mentioned; for consistency of thought may come with time and training;
but clearness of inward vision, the faculty of imagination, can be no
more learnt than it can be dispensed with.&nbsp; In this, and this only
it is true that poeta nascitur non fit; just as no musical learning
or practice can make a composer, unless he first possess an innate ear
for harmony and melody.&nbsp; And it must be said that it is just in
the passages where Mr. Smith is not copying, where he forgets for awhile
Shelley, Keats, and the rest, and is content to be simply himself, that
he is best; terse, vivid, sound, manly, simple.&nbsp; May he turn round
some day, and deliberately pulling out all borrowed feathers, look at
himself honestly and boldly in the glass, and we will warrant him, on
the strength of the least gaudy, and as yet unpraised passages in his
poems, that he will find himself after all more eagle than daw, and
quite well plumed enough by nature to fly at a higher, because for him
a more natural, pitch than he has yet done.</p>
<p>True, he has written a great deal of nonsense; nonsense in matter
as well as in manner.&nbsp; But therein, too, he has only followed the
reigning school.&nbsp; As for manner, he does sometimes, in imitating
his models, out-Herod Herod.&nbsp; But why not?&nbsp; If Herod be a
worthy king, let him be by all means out-Heroded, if any man can do
it.&nbsp; One cannot have too much of a good thing.&nbsp; If it be right
to bedizen verses with metaphors and similes which have no reference,
either in tone or in subject, to the matter in hand, let there be as
many of them as possible.&nbsp; If a saddle is a proper place for jewels,
then let the seat be paved with diamonds and emeralds, and Runjeet Singh&rsquo;s
harness-maker be considered as a lofty artist, for whose barbaric splendour
Mr. Peat and his Melton customers are to forswear pigskin and severe
simplicity&mdash;not to say utility and comfort.&nbsp; If poetic diction
be different in species from plain English, then let us have it as poetical
as possible, and as unlike English; as ungrammatical, abrupt, involved,
transposed, as the clumsiness, carelessness, or caprice of man can make
it.&nbsp; If it be correct to express human thought by writing whole
pages of vague and bald abstract metaphysic, and then trying to explain
them by concrete concetti, which bear an entirely accidental and mystical
likeness to the notion which they are to illustrate, then let the metaphysic
be as abstract as possible, the concetti as fanciful and far-fetched
as possible.&nbsp; If Marino and Cowley be greater poets than Ariosto
and Milton, let young poets imitate the former with might and main,
and avoid spoiling their style by any perusal of the too-intelligible
common sense of the latter.&nbsp; If Byron&rsquo;s moral (which used
to be thought execrable) be really his great excellence, and his style
(which used to be thought almost perfect) unworthy of this age of progress,
then let us have his moral without his style, his matter without his
form; or&mdash;that we may be sure of never falling for a moment into
his besetting sins of terseness, grace, and completeness&mdash;without
any form at all.&nbsp; If poetry, in order to be worthy of the nineteenth
century, ought to be as unlike as possible to Homer or Sophocles, Virgil
or Horace, Shakespeare or Spenser, Dante or Tasso, let those too-idolised
names be erased henceforth from the calendar; let the &ldquo;Ars Poetica&rdquo;
be consigned to flames, and Martinus Scriblerus&rsquo;s &ldquo;Art of
Sinking&rdquo; placed forthwith on the list of the Committee of Council
for Education, that not a working man in England may he ignorant that,
whatsoever superstitions about art may have haunted the benighted heathens
who built the Parthenon, <i>nous avons chang&eacute; tout cela</i>.&nbsp;
In one word, if it be best and most fitting to write poetry in the style
in which almost every one has been trying to write it since Pope and
plain sense went out, and Shelley and the seventh heaven came in, let
it be so written; and let him who most perfectly so &ldquo;sets the
age to music,&rdquo; he presented by the assembled guild of critics,
not with the obsolete and too classic laurel, but with an electro-plated
brass medal, bearing the due inscription, &ldquo;Ars est nescire artem.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And when, in twelve months&rsquo; time, he finds himself forgotten,
perhaps decried, for the sake of the next aspirant, let him reconsider
himself, try whether, after all, the common sense of the many will not
prove a juster and a firmer standing-ground than the sentimentality
and bad taste of the few, and read Alexander Pope.</p>
<p>In Pope&rsquo;s writings, whatsoever he may not find, he will find
the very excellences after which our young poets strive in vain, produced
by their seeming opposites, which are now despised and discarded; naturalness
produced by studious art; sublimity by strict self-restraint; depth
by clear simplicity; pathos by easy grace; and a morality infinitely
more merciful, as well as more righteous, than the one now in vogue
among the poetasters, by honest faith in God.&nbsp; If he be shocked
by certain peculiarities of diction, and by the fondness for perpetual
antitheses, let him remember, that what seems strange to our day was
natural and habitual in Pope&rsquo;s; and that, in the eyes of our grandchildren,
Keats&rsquo;s and Shelley&rsquo;s peculiarities will seem as monstrous
as Pope&rsquo;s or Johnson&rsquo;s do in ours.&nbsp; But if, misled
by the popular contempt for Pope, be should he inclined to answer this
advice with a shrug and a smile, we entreat him and all young poets,
to consider, line by line, word by word, sound by sound, only those
once well-known lines, which many a brave and wise man of fifty years
ago would have been unable to read without honourable tears:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>In the worst inn&rsquo;s worst room, with mat half-hung,<br />The
floor of plaster, and the walls of dung,<br />On once a flock-bed, but
repaired with straw,<br />With tape-tied curtains never meant to draw,<br />The
George and Garter, dangling from that bed,<br />Where tawdry yellow
strove with dirty red,<br />Great Villiers lies.&nbsp; Alas! how changed
from him,<br />That life of pleasure, and that soul of whim!<br />Gallant
and gay, in Cliveden&rsquo;s proud alcove,<br />The bower of wanton
Shrewsbury and love;<br />Or just as gay, at Council, in a ring<br />Of
mimic statesmen, and their merry king,<br />No wit to flatter, left
of all his store!<br />No fool to laugh at, which he valued more.<br />There,
victor of his health, of fortune, friends,<br />And fame, this lord
of useless thousands ends.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Yes; Pope knew, as well as Wordsworth and our &ldquo;Naturalisti,&rdquo;
that no physical fact was so mean or coarse as to be below the dignity
of poetry&mdash;when in its right place.&nbsp; He could draw a pathos
and sublimity out of the dirty inn chamber, such as Wordsworth never
elicited from tubs and daffodils&mdash;because he could use them according
to the rules of art, which are the rules of sound reason and of true
taste.</p>
<p>The answer to all this is ready nowadays.&nbsp; We are told that
Pope could easily be great in what he attempted, because he never attempted
any but small matters; easily self-restraining, because his paces were
naturally so slow; above all, easily clear, because he is always shallow;
easily full of faith in what he did believe, because he believed so
very little.&nbsp; On the two former counts we may have something to
say hereafter.&nbsp; On the two latter, we will say at once, that if
it be argued, as it often is, that the reason of our modern poetical
obscurity and vagueness lies in the greater depth of the questions which
are now agitating thoughtful minds, we do utterly deny it.&nbsp; Human
nature, human temptations, human problems, are radically the same in
every age, by whatsoever outward difference of words they may seem distinguished.&nbsp;
Where is deeper philosophic thought, true or false, expressed in verse,
than in Dante, or in Spenser&rsquo;s two cantos of &ldquo;Mutabilities&rdquo;?&nbsp;
Yet if they are difficult to understand, their darkness is that of the
deep blue sea.&nbsp; Vague they never are, obscure they never are, because
they see clearly what they want to say, and how to say it.&nbsp; There
is always a sound and coherent meaning in them, to be found if it be
searched for.</p>
<p>The real cause of this modern vagueness is rather to be found in
shallow and unsound culture, and in that inability, or carelessness
about seeing any object clearly, which besets our poets just now; as
the cause of antique clearness lies in the nobler and healthier manhood,
in the severer and more methodic habits of thought, the sounder philosophic
and critical training, which enabled Spenser and Milton to draw up a
state paper, or to discourse deep metaphysics, with the same manful
possession of their subject which gives grace and completeness to the
&ldquo;Penseroso&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Epithalamion.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
if our poets have their doubts, they should remember, that those to
whom doubt and inquiry are real and stern, are not inclined to sing
about them till they can sing poems of triumph over them.&nbsp; There
has no temptation taken our modern poets save that which is common to
man&mdash;the temptation of wishing to make the laws of the universe
and of art fit them, as they do not feel inclined to make themselves
fit the laws, or care to find them out.</p>
<p>What!&nbsp; Do you wish, asks some one, a little contemptuously,
to measure the great growing nineteenth century by the thumb-rule of
Alexander Pope?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; But to measure the men who write in
the nineteenth century by a man who wrote in the eighteenth; to compare
their advantages with his, their circumstances with his: and then, if
possible, to make them ashamed of their unmanliness.&nbsp; Have you
young poets of this day, your struggles, your chagrins?&nbsp; Do you
think the hump-backed dwarf, every moment conscious at once of his deformity
and his genius&mdash;conscious, probably, of far worse physical shame
than any deformity can bring, &ldquo;sewed up in buckram every morning,
and requiring a nurse like a child&rdquo;&mdash;caricatured, lampooned,
slandered, utterly without fault of his own&mdash;insulted and rejected
by the fine lady whom he had dared to court in reality, after being
allowed and allured to flirt with her in rhyme&mdash;do you suppose
that this man had nothing to madden him&mdash;to convert him into a
sneering snarling misanthrope?&nbsp; Yet was there one noble soul who
met him who did not love him, or whom he did not love?&nbsp; Have you
your doubts?&nbsp; Do you find it difficult to make your own speculations,
even your own honest convictions, square with the popular superstitions?&nbsp;
What were your doubts, your inward contradictions, to those of a man
who, bred a Papist, and yet burning with the most intense scorn and
hatred of lies and shams, bigotries and priestcrafts, could write that
&ldquo;Essay on Man&rdquo;?&nbsp; Read that, young gentlemen of the
Job&rsquo;s-wife school, who fancy it a fine thing to tell your readers
to curse God and die, or, at least, to show the world in print how you
could curse God by divine right of genius, if you chose, and be ashamed
of your cowardly wailings.</p>
<p>Alexander Pope went through doubt, contradiction, confusion, to which
yours are simple and light; and conquered.&nbsp; He was a man of like
passions with yourselves; infected with the peculiar vices of his day;
narrow, for his age was narrow; shallow, for his age was shallow; a
bon-vivant, for his age was a gluttonous and drunken one; bitter, furious,
and personal, for men round him were such; foul-mouthed often, and indecent,
as the rest were.&nbsp; Nay, his very power, when he abuses it for his
own ends of selfish spite and injured vanity, makes him, as all great
men can be (in words at least, for in life he was far better than the
men around him), worse than his age.&nbsp; He can out-rival Dennis in
ferocity, and Congreve in filth.&nbsp; So much the worse for him in
that account which he has long ago rendered up.&nbsp; But in all times
and places, as far as we can judge, the man was heart-whole, more and
not less righteous than his fellows.&nbsp; With his whole soul he hates
what is evil, as far as he can recognise it.&nbsp; With his whole soul
he loves what is good, as far as he can recognise that.&nbsp; With his
soul believes that there is a righteous and good God, whose order no
human folly or crime can destroy; and he will say so; and does say it,
clearly, simply, valiantly, reverently, in his &ldquo;Essay on Man.&rdquo;&nbsp;
His theodicy is narrow; shallow, as was the philosophy of his age.&nbsp;
But as far as it goes, it is sound&mdash;faithful to God, and to what
he sees and knows.&nbsp; Man is made in God&rsquo;s image.&nbsp; Man&rsquo;s
justice is God&rsquo;s justice; man&rsquo;s mercy is God&rsquo;s mercy;
man&rsquo;s science, man&rsquo;s critic taste, are insights into the
laws of God himself.&nbsp; He does not pretend to solve the great problem.&nbsp;
But he believes that it is solved from all eternity; that God knows,
God loves, and God rules; that the righteous and faithful man may know
enough of the solution to know his duty, to see his way, to justify
God; and as much as he knows he tells.&nbsp; There were in that diseased
sensitive cripple no vain repinings, no moon-struck howls, no impious
cries against God: &ldquo;Why hast thou made me thus?&rdquo;&nbsp; To
him God is a righteous God, a God of order.&nbsp; Science, philosophy,
politics, criticism, poetry, are parts of His order&mdash;they are parts
of the appointed onward path for mankind; there are eternal laws for
them.&nbsp; There is a beautiful and fit order, in poetry, which is
part of God&rsquo;s order, which men have learnt ages ago, for they,
too, had their teaching from above; to offend against which is absolutely
wrong, an offence to be put down mildly in those who offend ignorantly;
but those who offend from dulness, from the incapacity to see the beautiful,
or from carelessness about it, when praise or gain tempts them the other
way, have some moral defect in them; they are what Solomon calls fools:
they are the enemies of man; and he will &ldquo;hate them right sore,
even as though they were his own enemies&rdquo;&mdash;which indeed they
were.&nbsp; He knows by painful experience that they deserve no quarter;
that there is no use giving them any; to spare them is to make them
insolent; to fondle the reptile is to be bitten by it.&nbsp; True poetry,
as the messenger of heavenly beauty, is decaying; true refinement, true
loftiness of thought, even true morality, are at stake.&nbsp; And so
he writes his &ldquo;Dunciad.&rdquo;&nbsp; And would that he were here,
to write it over again, and write it better!</p>
<p>For write it again he surely would.&nbsp; And write it better he
would also.&nbsp; With the greater cleanliness of our time, with all
the additional experience of history, with the greater classical, &aelig;sthetic,
and theological knowledge of our day, the sins of our poets are as much
less excusable than those of Eusden, Blackmore, Cibber, and the rest,
as Pope&rsquo;s &ldquo;Dunciad&rdquo; on them would be more righteously
severe.&nbsp; What, for instance, would the author of the &ldquo;Essay
on Man&rdquo; say to anyone who now wrote p. 137 (for it really is not
to be quoted) of the &ldquo;Life Drama&rdquo; as the thoughts of his
hero, without any after atonement for the wanton insult it conveys toward
him whom he dares in the same breath to call &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; simply
because he wants to be something very fine and famous and self-glorifying,
and Providence keeps him waiting awhile?&nbsp; Has Pope not said it
already?</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Persist, by all divine in man unawed,<br />But learn, ye dunces,
not to scorn your God!</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>And yet no; the gentle goddess would now lay no such restriction
on her children, for in Pope&rsquo;s day no man had discovered the new
poetic plan for making the divine in man an excuse for scorning God,
and finding in the dignity of &ldquo;heaven-born genius&rdquo; free
licence to upbraid, on the very slightest grounds, the Being from whom
the said genius pretends to derive his dignity.&nbsp; In one of his
immortal saws he has cautioned us against &ldquo;making God in man&rsquo;s
image.&rdquo;&nbsp; But it never entered into his simple head that man
would complain of God for being made in a lower image than even his
own.&nbsp; Atheism he could conceive of; the deeper absurdity of Authotheism
was left for our more enlightened times and more spiritual muses.</p>
<p>It will be answered that all this blasphemy is not to be attributed
to the author, but to the man whose spiritual development he intends
to sketch.&nbsp; To which we reply that no man has a right to bring
his hero through such a state without showing how he came out of the
slough as carefully as how he came into it, especially when the said
hero is set forth as a marvellously clever person; and the last scene,
though full of beautiful womanly touches, and of a higher morality than
the rest of the book, contains no amende honorable, not even an explanation
of the abominable stuff which the hero has been talking a few pages
back.&nbsp; He leaps from the abyss to the seventh heaven; but, unfortunately
for the spectators, he leaps behind the scenes, and they are none the
wiser.&nbsp; And next; people have no more right even for dramatic purposes,
to put such language into print for any purpose whatsoever, than they
have to print the grossest indecencies, or the most disgusting details
of torture and cruelty.&nbsp; No one can accuse this magazine of any
fondness for sanctimonious cant or lip-reverence; but if there be a
&ldquo;Father in Heaven,&rdquo; as Mr. Smith confesses that there is,
or even merely a personal Deity at all, some sort of common decency
in speaking of Him should surely be preserved.&nbsp; No one would print
pages of silly calumny and vulgar insult against his earthly father,
or even against a person for whom he had no special dislike, and then
excuse it by, &ldquo;Of course, I don&rsquo;t think so: but if anyone
did think so, this would be a very smart way of saying what he thought.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Old Aristotle would call such an act &ldquo;banauson&rdquo;&mdash;in
plain English, blackguard; and we do not see how it can be called anything
else, unless in the case of some utter brute in human form, to whom
&ldquo;there is no c&oelig;num, and therefore no obsc&oelig;num; no
fanum, and therefore no profanum.&rdquo;&nbsp; The common sense of mankind
in all ages has condemned this sort of shamelessness, even more than
it has insults to parental and social ties, and to all which raises
man above the brute.&nbsp; Let Mr. Smith take note of this, and let
him, if he loves himself, mend speedily; for of all styles wherein to
become stereotyped the one which he has chosen is the worst, because
in it the greatest amount of insincerity is possible.&nbsp; There is
a Tartarus in front of him as well as an Olympus; a hideous possibility
very near him of insincere impiety merely for the purpose of startling;
of lawless fancy merely for the purpose of glittering; and a still more
hideous possibility of a revulsion to insincere cant, combined with
the same lawless fancy, for the purpose of keeping well with the public,
in which to all appearances one of our most popular novelists, not to
mention the poet whose writings are most analogous to Mr. Smith&rsquo;s,
now lies wallowing.</p>
<p>Whether he shall hereafter obey his evil angel, and follow him, or
his good angel, and become a great poet, depends upon himself; and above
all upon his having courage to be himself, and to forget himself, two
virtues which, paradoxical as it may seem, are correlatives.&nbsp; For
the &ldquo;subjective&rdquo; poet&mdash;in plain words, the egotist&mdash;is
always comparing himself with every man he meets, and therefore momentarily
tempted to steal bits of their finery wherewith to patch his own rents;
while the man who is content to be simply what God has made him, goes
on from strength to strength developing almost unconsciously under a
divine education, by which his real personality and the salient points
by which he is distinguished from his fellows, become apparent with
more and more distinctness of form, and brilliance of light and shadow,
as those well know who have watched human character attain its clearest
and grandest as well as its loveliest outlines, not among hankerers
after fame and power, but on lonely sickbeds, and during long unknown
martyrdoms of humble self-sacrifice and loving drudgery.</p>
<p>But whether or not Mr. Smith shall purify himself&mdash;and he can
do so, if he will, right nobly&mdash;the world must be purified of his
style of poetry, if men are ever, as he hopes, to &ldquo;set his age
to music;&rdquo; much more if they are once more to stir the hearts
of the many by Tyrt&aelig;an strains, such as may be needed before our
hairs are gray.&nbsp; The &ldquo;poetry of doubt,&rdquo; however pretty,
would stand us in little stead if we were threatened with a second Armada.&nbsp;
It will conduce little to the valour, &ldquo;virtus,&rdquo; manhood
of any Englishman to be informed by any poet, even in the most melodious
verse, illustrated by the most startling and pan cosmic metaphors.&nbsp;
&ldquo;See what a highly-organised and peculiar stomach-ache I have
had!&nbsp; Does it not prove indisputably that I am not as other men
are?&rdquo;&nbsp; What gospel there can be in such a message to any
honest man who has either to till the earth, plan a railroad, colonise
Australia, or fight his country&rsquo;s enemies, is hard to discover.&nbsp;
Hard indeed to discover how this most practical, and therefore most
poetical, of ages, is to be &ldquo;set to music,&rdquo; when all those
who talk about so doing persist obstinately in poring, with introverted
eyes, over the state of their own digestion&mdash;or creed.</p>
<p>What man wants, what art wants, perhaps what the Maker of them both
wants, is a poet who shall begin by confessing that he is as other men
are, and sing about things which concern all men, in language which
all men can understand.&nbsp; This is the only road to that gift of
prophecy which most young poets are nowadays in such a hurry to arrogate
to themselves.&nbsp; We can only tell what man will be by fair induction,
by knowing what he is, what he has been.</p>
<p>And it is most noteworthy that in this age, in which there is more
knowledge than there ever was of what man has been, and more knowledge,
through innumerable novelists, and those most subtle and finished ones,
of what man is, that poetry should so carefully avoid drawing from this
fresh stock of information in her so-confident horoscopes of what man
will be.</p>
<p>There is just now as wide a divorce between poetry and the common-sense
of all time, as there is between poetry and modern knowledge.&nbsp;
Our poets are not merely vague and confused, they are altogether fragmentary&mdash;disjecta
membra poetarum; they need some uniting idea.&nbsp; And what idea?</p>
<p>Our answer will probably be greeted with a laugh.&nbsp; Nevertheless
we answer simply, What our poets want is faith.</p>
<p>There is little or no faith nowadays.&nbsp; And without faith there
can be no real art, for art is the outward expression of firm coherent
belief.&nbsp; And a poetry of doubt, even a sceptical poetry, in its
true sense, can never possess clear and sound form, even organic form
at all.&nbsp; How can you put into form that thought which is by its
very nature formless?&nbsp; How can you group words round a central
idea when you do not possess a central idea?&nbsp; Shakespeare in his
one sceptic tragedy has to desert the pure tragic form, and Hamlet remains
the beau-ideal of &ldquo;the poetry of doubt.&rdquo;&nbsp; But what
would a tragedy be in which the actors were all Hamlets, or rather scraps
of Hamlets?&nbsp; A drama of Hamlet is only possible because the one
sceptic is surrounded by characters who have some positive faith, who
do their work for good or evil undoubtingly while he is speculating
about his.&nbsp; And both Ophelia, and Laertes, Fortinbras, the king,
yea the very grave-digger, know well enough what they want, whether
Hamlet does or not.&nbsp; The whole play is, in fact, Shakespeare&rsquo;s
subtle reductio ad absurdum of that very diseased type of mind which
has been for the last forty years identified with &ldquo;genius&rdquo;&mdash;with
one difference, namely, that Shakespeare, with his usual clearness of
conception, exhibits the said intellectual type pure and simple, while
modern poets degrade and confuse it, and all the questions dependent
on it, by mixing it up unnecessarily with all manner of moral weaknesses,
and very often moral crimes.</p>
<p>But the poet is to have a faith nowadays of course&mdash;a &ldquo;faith
in nature.&rdquo;&nbsp; This article of Wordsworth&rsquo;s poetical
creed is to be assumed as the only necessary one, and we are to ignore
altogether the somewhat important fact that he had faith in a great
deal besides nature, and to make that faith in nature his sole differentia
and source of inspiration.&nbsp; Now we beg leave to express not merely
our want of faith in this same &ldquo;faith in nature,&rdquo; but even
our ignorance of what it means.&nbsp; Nature is certain phenomena, appearances.&nbsp;
Faith in them is simply to believe that a red thing is red, and a square
thing square; a sine qua non doubtless in poetry, as in carpentry, but
which will produce no poetry, but only Dutch painting and gardeners&rsquo;
catalogues&mdash;in a word, that lowest form of art, the merely descriptive;
and into this very style the modern naturalist poets, from the times
of Southey and Wordsworth, have been continually falling, and falling
therefore into baldness and vulgarity.&nbsp; For mere description cannot
represent even the outlines of a whole scene at once, as the daguerreotype
does; they must describe it piecemeal.&nbsp; Much less can it represent
that whole scene at once in all its glories of colour, glow, fragrance,
life, motion.&nbsp; In short, it cannot give life and spirit.&nbsp;
All merely descriptive poetry can do is to give a dead catalogue&mdash;to
kill the butterfly, and then write a monograph on it.&nbsp; And, therefore,
there comes a natural revulsion from the baldness and puerility into
which Wordsworth too often fell by indulging his false theories on these
matters.</p>
<p>But a revulsion to what?&nbsp; To the laws of course which underlie
the phenomena.&nbsp; But again&mdash;to which laws?&nbsp; Not merely
to the physical ones, else Turner&rsquo;s &ldquo;Chemistry&rdquo; and
Watson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Practice of Medicine&rdquo; are great poems.</p>
<p>True, we have heard Professor Forbes&rsquo;s book on Glaciers called
an epic poem, and not without reason: but what gives that noble book
its epic character is neither the glaciers nor the laws of them, but
the discovery of those laws: the methodic, truthful, valiant, patient
battle between man and nature, his final victory, his wresting from
her the secret which had been locked for ages in the ice-caves of the
Alps, guarded by cold and fatigue, danger and superstitious dread.&nbsp;
For Nature will be permanently interesting to the poet, and appear to
him in a truly poetic aspect, only in as far as she is connected by
him with spiritual and personal beings, and becomes in his eyes either
a person herself, or the dwelling and organ of persons.&nbsp; The shortest
scrap of word-painting, as Thomson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Seasons&rdquo; will
sufficiently prove, is wearisome and dead, unless there be a living
figure in the landscape, or unless, failing a living figure, the scene
is deliberately described with reference to the poet or the reader,
not as something in itself, but as something seen by him, and grouped
and subordinated exactly as it would strike his eye and mind.&nbsp;
But even this is insufficient.&nbsp; The heart of man demands more,
and so arises a craving after the old nature-mythology of Greece, the
old fairy legends of the Middle Age.&nbsp; The great poets of the Renaissance
both in England and in Italy had a similar craving.&nbsp; But the aspect
under which these ancient dreams are regarded by them is most significantly
different.&nbsp; With Spenser and Ariosto, fairies and elves, gods and
demons, are regarded in their fancied connection with man.&nbsp; Even
in the age of Pope, when the gods and the Rosicrucian Sylphs have become
alike &ldquo;poetical machinery,&rdquo; this is their work.&nbsp; But
among the moderns it is as connected with Nature, and giving a soul
and a personality to her, that they are most valued.&nbsp; The most
pure utterance of this feeling is perhaps Schiller&rsquo;s &ldquo;Gods
of Greece,&rdquo; where the loss of the Olympians is distinctly deplored,
because it has unpeopled, not heaven, but earth.&nbsp; But the same
tone runs through Goethe&rsquo;s classical &ldquo;Walpurgis Night,&rdquo;
where the old human &ldquo;twelve gods,&rdquo; the antitypes and the
friends of men, in whom our forefathers delighted, have vanished utterly,
and given place to semi-physical Nereides, Tritons, Telchines, Psylli,
and Seismos himself.</p>
<p>Keats, in his wonderful &ldquo;Endymion,&rdquo; contrived to unite
the two aspects of Greek mythology as they never had been united before,
except by Spenser in his &ldquo;Garden of Adonis.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the
pantheistic notion, as he himself says in &ldquo;Lamia,&rdquo; was the
one which lay nearest his heart; and in his &ldquo;Hyperion&rdquo; he
begins to deal wholly with the Nature gods, and after magnificent success,
leaves the poem unfinished, most probably because he had become, as
his readers must, weary of its utter want of human interest.&nbsp; For
that, after all, is what is wanted in a poetical view of Nature; and
that is what the poet, in proportion to his want of dramatic faculty,
must draw from himself.&nbsp; He must&mdash;he does in these days&mdash;colour
Nature with the records of his own mind, and bestow a factitious life
and interest on her by making her reflect his own joy or sorrow.&nbsp;
If he be out of humour, she must frown; if he sigh, she must roar; if
he be&mdash;what he very seldom is&mdash;tolerably comfortable, the
birds have liberty to sing, and the sun to shine.&nbsp; But by the time
that he has arrived at this stage of his development, or degradation,
the poet is hardly to be called a strong man, he who is so munch the
slave of his own moods that he must needs see no object save through
them, is not very likely to be able to resist the awe which nature&rsquo;s
grandeur and inscrutability brings with it, and to say firmly, and yet
reverently:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Si fractus illibatur orbis,<br />Impavidum ferient ruin&aelig;.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>He feels, in spite of his conceit, that nature is not going his way,
or looking his looks, but going what he calls her own way, what we call
God&rsquo;s way.&nbsp; At all events, he feels that he is lying, when
he represents the great universe as turned to his small set of Pan&rsquo;s
pipes and all the more because he feels that, conceal it as he will,
those same Pan&rsquo;s pipes are out of tune with each other.&nbsp;
And so arises the habit of impersonating nature, not after the manner
of Spenser (whose purity of metaphor and philosophic method, when he
deals with nature, is generally even more marvellous than the richness
of his fancy), as an organic whole, but in her single and accidental
phenomena; and of ascribing not merely animal passions or animal enjoyment,
but human discursive intellect and moral sense, to inanimate objects,
and talking as if a stick or a stone were more of a man than the poet
is&mdash;as indeed they very often may be.</p>
<p>These, like everything else, are perfectly right in their own place&mdash;where
they express passion, either pleasurable or painful, passion, that is,
not so intense as to sink into exhaustion, or to be compelled to self-control
by the fear of madness.&nbsp; In these two cases, as great dramatists
know well enough, the very violence of the emotion produces perfect
simplicity, as the hurricane blows the sea smooth.&nbsp; But where fanciful
language is employed to express the extreme of passion, it is felt to
be absurd, and is accordingly called rant and bombast: and where it
is not used to express passion at all, but merely the quiet and normal
state of the poet&rsquo;s mind, or of his characters, with regard to
external nature; when it is considered, as it is by most of our modern
poets, the staple of poetry, indeed poetic diction itself, so that the
more numerous and the stranger conceits an author can cram into his
verses, the finer poet he is; then, also, it is called rant and bombast,
but of the most artificial, insincere, and (in every sense of the word)
monstrous kind; the offspring of an effeminate nature-worship, without
self-respect, without true manhood, because it exhibits the poet as
the puppet of his own momentary sensations, and not as a man superior
to nature, claiming his likeness to the Author of nature, by confessing
and expressing the permanent laws of Nature, undisturbed by fleeting
appearances without, or fleeting tempers within.&nbsp; Hence it is that,
as in all insincere and effete times, the poetry of the day deals more
and more with conceits, and less and less with true metaphors.&nbsp;
In fact, hinc ill&aelig; lachrym&aelig;.&nbsp; This is, after all, the
primary symptom of disease in the public taste, which has set us on
writing this review&mdash;that critics all round are crying: &ldquo;An
ill-constructed whole, no doubt; but full of beautiful passages&rdquo;&mdash;the
word &ldquo;passages&rdquo; turning out to mean, in plain English, conceits.&nbsp;
The simplest distinction, perhaps, between an image and a conceit is
this&mdash;that while both are analogies, the image is founded on an
analogy between the essential properties of two things&mdash;the conceit
on an analogy between its accidents.&nbsp; Images, therefore, whether
metaphors or similes, deal with laws; conceits with private judgments.&nbsp;
Images belong to the imagination, the power which sees things according
to their real essence and inward life, and conceits to the fancy or
phantasy, which only see things as they appear.</p>
<p>To give an example or two from the &ldquo;Life Drama:&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His heart holds a deep hope,<br />As holds the
wretched West the sunset&rsquo;s corse&mdash;<br />Spit on, insulted
by the brutal rains.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passion-panting sea<br />Watches the unveiled
beauty of the stars<br />Like a great hungry soul.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great spirits,<br />Who left upon the mountain-tops
of Death<br />A light that made them lovely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moon,<br />Arising from dark waves which plucked
at her.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>And hundreds, nay, thousands more in this book, whereof it must be
said, that beautiful or not, in the eyes of the present generation&mdash;and
many of them are put into very beautiful language, and refer to very
beautiful natural objects&mdash;they are not beautiful really and in
themselves, because they are mere conceits; the analogies in them are
fortuitous, depending not on the nature of the things themselves, but
on the private fancy of the writer, having no more real and logical
coherence than a conundrum or a pun; in plain English, untrue, only
allowable to Juliets or Othellos; while their self-possession, almost
their reason, is in temporary abeyance under the influence of joy or
sorrow.&nbsp; Every one must feel the exquisite fitness of Juliet&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Gallop apace, ye fiery-footed steeds,&rdquo; etc., for one of
her character, in her circumstances: every one, we trust, and Mr. Smith
among the number, will some day feel the exquisite unfitness of using
such conceits as we have just quoted, or any other, page after page,
for all characters and chances.&nbsp; For the West is not wretched;
the rains never were brutal yet, and do not insult the sun&rsquo;s corpse,
being some millions of miles nearer us than the sun, but only have happened
once to seem to do so in the poet&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; The sea does not
pant with passion, does not hunger after the beauty of the stars; Death
has no mountain-tops, or any property which can be compared thereto;
and &ldquo;the dark waves&rdquo;&mdash;in that most beautiful conceit
which follows, and which Mr. Smith has borrowed from Mr. Bailey, improving
it marvellously nevertheless&mdash;do not &ldquo;pluck at the moon,&rdquo;
but only seem to do so.&nbsp; And what constitutes the beauty of this
very conceit&mdash;far the best of those we have chosen&mdash;but that
it looks so very like an image, so very like a law, from being so very
common and customary an ocular deception to one standing on a low shore
at night?</p>
<p>Or, again, in a passage which has been already often quoted as exquisite,
and in its way is so:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bridegroom sea<br />Is toying with the shore,
his wedded bride;<br />And in the fulness of his marriage joy<br />He
decorates her tawny brow with shells,<br />Retires a pace, to see how
fair she looks,<br />Then proud, runs up to kiss her.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Exquisite?&nbsp; Yes; but only exquisitely pretty.&nbsp; It is untrue&mdash;a
false explanation of the rush and recoil of the waves.&nbsp; We learn
nothing by these lines; we gain no fresh analogy between the physical
and the spiritual world, not even between two different parts of the
physical world.&nbsp; If the poetry of this age has a peculiar mission,
it is to declare that such an analogy exists throughout the two worlds;
then let poetry declare it.&nbsp; Let it set forth a real intercommunion
between man and nature, grounded on a communion between man and God,
who made nature.&nbsp; Let it accept nature&rsquo;s laws as the laws
of God.&nbsp; Truth, scientific truth, is the only real beauty.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Let God be true, and every man a liar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, be it remembered that by far the greater proportion of this
book consists of such thoughts as these; and that these are what are
called its beauties; these are what young poets try more and more daily
to invent&mdash;conceits, false analogies.&nbsp; Be it remembered, that
the affectation of such conceits has always marked the decay and approaching
death of a reigning school of poetry; that when, for instance, the primeval
forest of the Elizabethan poets dwindled down into a barren scrub of
Vaughans, and Cowleys, and Herberts, and Crashawes, this was the very
form in which the deadly blight appeared.&nbsp; In vain did the poetasters,
frightened now and then at their own nonsense, try to keep up the decaying
dignity of poetry by drawing their conceits, as poetasters do now, from
suns and galaxies, earthquakes, eclipses, and the portentous, and huge
and gaudy in Nature; the lawlessness and irreverence for Nature, involved
in the very worship of conceits, went on degrading the tone of the conceits
themselves, till the very sense of true beauty and fitness seemed lost;
and a pious and refined gentleman like George Herbert could actually
dare to indite solemn conundrums to the Supreme Being, and believe that
he was writing devout poetry, and &ldquo;looking through nature up to
nature&rsquo;s God,&rdquo; when he delivered himself thus in one of
his least offensive poems (for the most sacred and most offensive of
them we dare not quote, lest we incur the same blame which we have bestowed
on Mr. Smith, and sing of Church festivals as&mdash;)</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Marrow of time, eternity in brief,<br />Compendiums epitomised, the

<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>That manner, happily for art, was silenced by the stern truth-loving
common sense of the Puritans.&nbsp; Whatsoever else, in their crusade
against shams, they were too hasty in sweeping away, they were right,
at least, in sweeping away such a sham as that.&nbsp; And now, when
a school has betaken itself to use the very same method in the cause
of blasphemy, instead of in that of cant, the Pope himself, with his
Index Prohibitus, might be a welcome guest, if he would but stop the
noise, and compel our doting Muses to sit awhile in silence, and reconsider
themselves.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, poets write about poets, and poetry, and guiding
the age, and curbing the world, and waking it, and thrilling it, and
making it start, and weep, and tremble, and self-conceit only knows
what else; and yet the age is not guided, or the world curbed, or thrilled,
or waked, or anything else, by them.&nbsp; Why should it be?&nbsp; Curb
and thrill the world?&nbsp; The world is just now a most practical world;
and these men are utterly unpractical.&nbsp; The age is given up to
physical science; these men disregard and outrage it in every page by
their false analogies.&nbsp; If they intend, as they say, to link heaven
and earth by preaching the analogy of matter and spirit, let them, in
the name of common prudence, observe the laws of matter, about which
the world does know something, and show their coincidence with the laws
of spirit&mdash;if indeed they know anything about the said laws.&nbsp;
Loose conceits, fancies of the private judgment, were excusable enough
in the Elizabethan poets.&nbsp; In their day, nature was still unconquered
by science; medieval superstitions still lingered in the minds of men
and the magical notions of nature which they had inherited from the
Middle Age received a corroboration from those neoplatonist dreamers,
whom they confounded with the true Greek philosophers.&nbsp; But, now
that Bacon has spoken, and that Europe has obeyed him, surely, among
the most practical, common sense, and scientific nation of the earth,
severely scientific imagery, imagery drawn from the inner laws of nature,
is necessary to touch the hearts of men.&nbsp; They know that the universe
is not such as poets paint it; they know that these pretty thoughts
are only pretty thoughts, springing from the caprice, the vanity, very
often from the indigestion of the gentlemen who take the trouble to
sing to them; and they listen, as they would to a band of street musicians,
and give them sixpence for their tune, and go on with their work.&nbsp;
The tune outside has nothing to do with the work inside.&nbsp; It will
not help them to be wiser, abler, more valiant&mdash;certainly not more
cheerful and hopeful men, and therefore they care no more for it than
they do for an opera or a pantomime, if as much.&nbsp; Whereupon the
poets get disgusted with the same hard-hearted prosaic world&mdash;which
is trying to get its living like an industrious animal as it is&mdash;and
demand homage&mdash;for what?&nbsp; For making a noise, pleasant or
otherwise?&nbsp; For not being as other men are?&nbsp; For pleading
&ldquo;the eccentricities of genius&rdquo; as an excuse for sitting
like naughty children in the middle of the schoolroom floor, in everybody&rsquo;s
way, shouting and playing on penny trumpets, and when begged to be quiet,
that other people may learn their lessons, considering themselves insulted,
and pleading &ldquo;genius&rdquo;?&nbsp; Genius!&mdash;hapless byword,
which, like charity, covers nowadays the multitude of sins, all the
seven deadly ones included!&nbsp; Is there any form of human folly which
one has not heard excused by &ldquo;He is a genius, you know&mdash;one
must not judge him by common rules.&rdquo;&nbsp; Poor genius, to have
come to this!&nbsp; To be, when confessed, not a reason for being more
of a man than others, but an excuse for being less of a man, less amenable
than the herd to the common laws of humanity, and therefore less able
than they to comprehend its common duties, common temptations, common
sins, common virtues, common destinies.&nbsp; Of old the wise singer
did by virtue of feeling with all, and obeying with all, learn to see
for all, to see eternal laws, eternal analogies, eternal consequences,
and so became a seer, vates, prophet; but now he is become a genius,
a poetical pharisee, a reviler of common laws and duties, the slave
of his own private judgment, who prophesies out of his own heart, and
hath seen nothing but only the appearances of things distorted and coloured
by &ldquo;genius.&rdquo;&nbsp; Heaven send the word, with many more,
a speedy burial!</p>
<p>And what becomes of artistic form in the hands of such a school?&nbsp;
Just what was to be expected.&nbsp; It is impossible to give outward
form to that which is in its very nature formless, like doubt and discontent.&nbsp;
For on such subjects thought itself is not defined; it has no limit,
no self-coherence, not even method or organic law.&nbsp; And in a poem,
as in all else, the body must be formed according to the law of the
inner life; the utterance must be the expression, the outward and visible
antetype of the spirit which animates it.&nbsp; But where the thought
is defined by no limits, it cannot express itself in form, for form
is that which has limits.&nbsp; Where it has no inward unity it cannot
have any outward one.&nbsp; If the spirit be impatient of all moral
rule, its utterance will be equally impatient of all artistic rule;
and thus, as we are now beginning to discover from experience, the poetry
of doubt will find itself unable to use those forms of verse which have
been always held to be the highest&mdash;tragedy, epic, the ballad,
and lastly, even the subjective lyrical ode.&nbsp; For they, too, to
judge by every great lyric which remains to us, require a groundwork
of consistent self-coherent belief; and they require also an appreciation
of melody even more delicate, and a verbal polish even more complete
than any other form of poetic utterance.&nbsp; But where there is no
melody within, there will be no melody without.&nbsp; It is in vain
to attempt the setting of spiritual discords to physical music.&nbsp;
The mere practical patience and self-restraint requisite to work out
rhythm when fixed on, will be wanting; nay, the fitting rhythm will
never be found, the subject itself being arhythmic; and thus we shall
have, or, rather, alas! do have, a wider and wider divorce of sound
and sense, a greater and greater carelessness for polish, and for the
charm of musical utterance, and watch the clear and spirit-stirring
melodies of the older poets swept away by a deluge of half-metrical
prose-run-mad, diffuse, unfinished, unmusical, to which any other metre
than that in which it happens to have been written would have been equally
appropriate, because all are equally inappropriate.&nbsp; Where men
have nothing to sing, it is not of the slightest consequence how they
sing it.</p>
<p>While poets persist in thinking and writing thus, it is in vain for
them to talk loud about the poet&rsquo;s divine mission, as the prophet
of mankind, the swayer of the universe, and so forth.&nbsp; Not that
we believe the poet simply by virtue of being a singer to have any such
power.&nbsp; While young gentlemen are talking about governing heaven
and earth by verse, Wellingtons and Peels, Arkwrights and Stephensons,
Frys, and Chisholms, are doing it by plain practical prose; and even
of those who have moved and led the hearts of men by verse, every one,
as far as we know, has produced his magical effects by poetry of the
very opposite forum to that which is now in fashion.&nbsp; What poet
ever had more influence than Homer?&nbsp; What poet is more utterly
antipodal to our modern schools?&nbsp; There are certain Hebrew psalms,
too, which will be confessed, even by those who differ most from them,
to have exercised some slight influence on human thought and action,
and to be likely to exercise the same for some time to come.&nbsp; Are
they any more like our modern poetic forms than they are like our modern
poetic matter?&nbsp; Ay, even in our own time, what has been the form,
what the temper, of all poetry, from K&ouml;rner and Heine, which has
made the German heart leap up, but simplicity, manhood, clearness, finished
melody, the very opposite, in a word, of our new school?&nbsp; And to
look at home, what is the modern poetry which lives on the lips and
in the hearts of Englishmen, Scotchmen, Irishmen?&nbsp; It is not only
simple in form and language, but much of it fitted, by a severe exercise
of artistic patience, to tunes already existing.&nbsp; Who does not
remember how the &ldquo;Marseillaise&rdquo; was born, or how Burns&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Scots wha ha&rsquo; wi&rsquo; Wallace bled,&rdquo; or the story
of Moore&rsquo;s taking the old &ldquo;Red Fox March,&rdquo; and giving
it a new immortality as &ldquo;Let Erin remember the days of old,&rdquo;
while poor Emmett sprang up and cried, &ldquo;Oh, that I had twenty
thousand Irishmen marching to that tune!&rdquo;&nbsp; So it is, even
to this day, and let those who hanker after poetic fame take note of
it; not a poem which is now really living but has gained its immortality
by virtue of simplicity and positive faith.</p>
<p>Let the poets of the new school consider carefully Wolfe&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Sir John Moore,&rdquo; Campbell&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hohenlinden,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Mariners of England,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Rule Britannia,&rdquo;
Hood&rsquo;s &ldquo;Song of the Shirt&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bridge of Sighs,&rdquo;
and then ask themselves, as men who would be poets: Were it not better
to have written any one of those glorious lyrics than all which John
Keats has left behind him?&nbsp; And let them be sure that, howsoever
they may answer the question to themselves, the sound heart of the English
people has already made its choice; and that when that beautiful &ldquo;Hero
and Leander,&rdquo; in which Hood has outrivalled the conceit-mongers
at their own weapons, by virtue of the very terseness, clearness, and
manliness which they neglect, has been gathered to the limbo of the
Crashawes and Marinos, his &ldquo;Song of the Shirt&rdquo; and his &ldquo;Bridge
of Sighs&rdquo; will be esteemed by great new English nations far beyond
the seas, for what they are&mdash;two of the most noble lyric poems
ever written by an English pen.&nbsp; If our poetasters talk with Wordsworth
of the dignity and pathos of the commonest human things, they will find
them there in perfection; if they talk about the cravings of the new
time, they will find them there.&nbsp; If they want the truly sublime
and the awful, they will find them there also.&nbsp; But they will find
none of their own favourite concetti; hardly even a metaphor; no taint
of this new poetic diction into which we have now fallen, after all
our abuse of the far more manly and sincere &ldquo;poetic diction&rdquo;
of the eighteenth century; they will find no loitering by the way to
argue and moralise, and grumble at Providence, and show off the author&rsquo;s
own genius and sensibility; they will find, in short, two real works
of art, earnest, melodious, self-forgetful, knowing clearly what they
want to say, and saying it in the shortest, the simplest, the calmest,
the most finished words.&nbsp; Saying it!&mdash;rather taught to say
it.&nbsp; For if that &ldquo;divine inspiration of poets,&rdquo; of
which the poetasters make such rash and irreverent boastings, have indeed,
as all ages have held, any reality corresponding to it, it will rather
be bestowed on such works as these, appeals from unrighteous man to
a righteous God, than on men whose only claim to celestial help seems
to be that mere passionate sensibility, which our modern Draco once
described when speaking of poor John Keats, as an infinite hunger after
all manner of pleasant things, crying to the universe: &lsquo;Oh that
thou wert one great lump of sugar, that I might suck thee!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our task is ended.&nbsp; We have given as plainly as we can our reasons
for the opinion which this magazine has expressed several times already,
that with the exception of Mr. Allingham, our young poets are a very
hopeless generation, and will so continue unless they utterly repent
and amend.&nbsp; If they do not choose to awaken themselves from within,
all that is left for us is to hope that they may be awakened from without,
or by some radical revulsion in public taste be shown their own real
value and durability, and compelled to be true and manly under pain
of being laughed at and forgotten.&nbsp; A general war might, amid all
its inevitable horrors, sweep away at once the dyspeptic unbelief, the
insincere bigotry, the effeminate frivolity which now paralyses our
poetry as much as it does our action, and strike from England&rsquo;s
heart a lightning flash of noble deeds, a thunder peal of noble song.&nbsp;
Such a case is neither an impossible nor a far-fetched one; let us not
doubt that by some other means if not by that, the immense volume of
thought and power which is still among us will soon find its utterance,
and justify itself to after ages by showing in harmonious and self-restrained
poetry its kinship to the heroic and the beautiful of every age and
clime.&nbsp; And till then, till the sunshine and the thaw shall come,
and the spring flowers burst into bud and bloom, heralding a new golden
year in the world&rsquo;s life, let us even be content with our pea-green
and orange fungi; nay, even admire them as not without their own tawdry
beauty, their clumsy fitness; for after all, they are products of nature,
though only of her dyspepsia; and grow and breed&mdash;as indeed cutaneous
disorders do&mdash;by an organic law of their own; fulfilling their
little destiny, and then making, according to Professor Way, by no means
bad manure.&nbsp; And so we take our leave of Mr. Alexander Smith, entreating
him, if these pages meet his eye, to consider three things, namely,
that in as far as he has written poetry, he is on the road to ruin by
reason of following the worst possible models.&nbsp; That in as far
as the prevailing taste has put these models before him, he is neither
to take much blame to himself, nor to be in anywise disheartened for
the future.&nbsp; That in as far as he shall utterly reverse his whole
poetic method, whether in morals or in &aelig;sthetics, leave undone
all that he has done, and do all that he has not done, he will become,
what he evidently, by grace of God, can become if he will, namely, a
lasting and a good poet.</p>

<h2>TENNYSON <a name="citation103"></a><a href="#footnote103">{103}</a></h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Critics cannot in general be too punctilious in their respect for
an incognito.&nbsp; If an author intended us to know his name, he would
put it on his title-page.&nbsp; If he does not choose to do that, we
have no more right to pry into his secret than we have to discuss his
family affairs or open his letters.&nbsp; But every rule has its exceptional
cases; and the book which stands first upon our list is surely such.&nbsp;
All the world, somehow or other, knows the author.&nbsp; His name has
been mentioned unhesitatingly by several reviews already, whether from
private information, or from the certainty which every well-read person
must feel that there is but one man in England possessed at once of
poetic talent and artistic experience sufficient for so noble a creation.&nbsp;
We hope, therefore, that we shall not be considered impertinent if we
ignore an incognito which all England has ignored before us, and attribute
&ldquo;In Memoriam&rdquo; to the pen of the author of &ldquo;The Princess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such a course will probably be the more useful one to our readers;
for this last work of our only living great poet seems to us at once
the culmination of all his efforts and the key to many difficulties
in his former writings.&nbsp; Heaven forbid that we should say that
it completes the circle of his powers.&nbsp; On the contrary, it gives
us hope of broader effort in new fields of thought and forms of art.&nbsp;
But it brings the development of his Muse and of his Creed to a positive
and definite point.&nbsp; It enables us to claim one who has been hitherto
regarded as belonging to a merely speculative and peirastic school as
the willing and deliberate champion of vital Christianity, and of an
orthodoxy the more sincere because it has worked upward through the
abyss of doubt; the more mighty for good because it justifies and consecrates
the &aelig;sthetics and the philosophy of the present age.&nbsp; We
are sure, moreover, that the author, whatever right reasons he may have
had for concealing his own name, would have no quarrel against us for
alluding to it, were he aware of the idolatry with which every utterance
of his is regarded by the cultivated young men of our day, especially
at the universities, and of the infinite service of which this &ldquo;In
Memoriam&rdquo; may be to them, if they are taught by it that their
superiors are not ashamed of faith, and that they will rise instead
of falling, fulfil instead of denying the cravings of their hearts and
intellects, if they will pass upwards with their teacher from the vague
though noble expectations of &ldquo;Locksley Hall,&rdquo; to the assured
and everlasting facts of the proem to &ldquo;In Memoriam&rdquo;&mdash;in
our eyes the noblest Christian poem which England has produced for two
centuries.</p>
<p>To explain our meaning, it will be necessary, perhaps, to go back
to Mr. Tennyson&rsquo;s earlier writings, of which he is said to be
somewhat ashamed now&mdash;a fastidiousness with which we will not quarrel;
for it should be the rule of the poet, forgetting those things which
are behind, to press on to those things which are before, and &ldquo;to
count not himself to have apprehended but&mdash;&rdquo; no, we will
not finish the quotation; let the readers of &ldquo;In Memoriam&rdquo;
finish it for themselves, and see how, after all, the poet, if he would
reach perfection, must be found by Him who found St. Paul of old.&nbsp;
In the meantime, as a true poet must necessarily be in advance of his
age, Mr. Tennyson&rsquo;s earlier poems, rather than these latter ones,
coincide with the tastes and speculations of the young men of this day.&nbsp;
And in proportion, we believe, as they thoroughly appreciate the distinctive
peculiarities of those poems, will they be able to follow the author
of them on his upward path.</p>
<p>Some of our readers, we would fain hope, remember as an era in their
lives the first day on which they read those earlier poems; how, fifteen
years ago, Mariana in the Moated Grange, &ldquo;The Dying Swan,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Lady of Shalott,&rdquo; came to them as revelations.&nbsp;
They seemed to themselves to have found at last a poet who promised
not only to combine the cunning melody of Moore, the rich fulness of
Keats, and the simplicity of Wordsworth, but one who was introducing
a method of observing nature different from that of all the three and
yet succeeding in everything which they had attempted, often in vain.&nbsp;
Both Keats and Moore had an eye for the beauty which lay in trivial
and daily objects.&nbsp; But in both of them, there was a want of deep
religious reverence, which kept Moore playing gracefully upon the surface
of phenomena without ever daring to dive into their laws or inner meaning;
and made poor Keats fancy that he was rather to render nature poetical
by bespangling her with florid ornament, than simply to confess that
she was already, by the grace of God, far beyond the need of his paint
and gilding.&nbsp; Even Wordsworth himself had not full faith in the
great dicta which he laid down in his famous Introductory Essay.&nbsp;
Deep as was his conviction that nature bore upon her simplest forms
the finger-mark of God, he did not always dare simply to describe her
as she was, and leave her to reveal her own mystery.&nbsp; We do not
say this in depreciation of one who stands now far above human praise
or blame.&nbsp; The wonder is, not that Wordsworth rose no higher, but
that, considering the level on which his taste was formed, he had power
to rise to the height above his age which he did attain.&nbsp; He did
a mighty work.&nbsp; He has left the marks of his teaching upon every
poet who has written verses worth reading for the last twenty years.&nbsp;
The idea by which he conquered was, as Coleridge well sets forth, the
very one which, in its practical results on his own poetry, procured
him loud and deserved ridicule.&nbsp; This, which will be the root idea
of the whole poetry of this generation, was the dignity of nature in
all her manifestations, and not merely in those which may happen to
suit the fastidiousness or Manich&aelig;ism of any particular age.&nbsp;
He may have been at times fanatical on his idea, and have misused it,
till it became self-contradictory, because he could not see the correlative
truths which should have limited it.&nbsp; But it is by fanatics, by
men of one great thought, that great works are done; and it is good
for the time that a man arose in it of fearless honesty enough to write
Peter Bell and the Idiot Boy, to shake all the old methods of nature-painting
to their roots, and set every man seriously to ask himself what he meant,
or whether he meant anything real, reverent, or honest, when he talked
about &ldquo;poetic diction,&rdquo; or &ldquo;the beauties of nature.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And after all, like all fanatics, Wordsworth was better than his own
creed.&nbsp; As Coleridge thoroughly shows in the second volume of the
&ldquo;Biographia Literaria,&rdquo; and as may be seen nowhere more
strikingly than in his grand posthumous work, his noblest poems and
noblest stanzas are those in which his true poetic genius, unconsciously
to himself, sets at naught his own pseudo-naturalist dogmas.</p>
<p>Now Mr. Tennyson, while fully adopting Wordsworth&rsquo;s principle
from the very first, seemed by instinctive taste to have escaped the
snares which had proved too subtle both for Keats and Wordsworth.&nbsp;
Doubtless there are slight <i>niaiseries</i>, after the manner of both
those poets, in the first editions of his earlier poems.&nbsp; He seems,
like most other great artists, to have first tried imitations of various
styles which already existed, before he learnt the art of incorporating
them into his own, and learning from all his predecessors, without losing
his own individual peculiarities.&nbsp; But there are descriptive passages
in them also which neither Keats nor Wordsworth could have written,
combining the honest sensuous observation which is common to them both,
with a self-restrained simplicity which Keats did not live long enough
to attain, and a stately and accurate melody, an earnest songfulness
(to coin a word) which Wordsworth seldom attained, and from his inaccurate
and uncertain ear, still seldomer preserved without the occurrence of
a jar or a rattle, a false quantity, a false rapture, or a bathos.&nbsp;
And above all, or rather beneath all&mdash;for we suspect that this
has been throughout the very secret of Mr. Tennyson&rsquo;s power&mdash;there
was a hush and a reverent awe, a sense of the mystery, the infinitude,
the awfulness, as well as of the mere beauty of wayside things, which
invested these poems as wholes with a peculiar richness, depth, and
majesty of tone, beside which both Keats&rsquo;s and Wordsworth&rsquo;s
methods of handling pastoral subjects looked like the colouring of Julio
Romano or Watteau by the side of Correggio or Titian.</p>
<p>This deep simple faith in the divineness of Nature as she appears,
which, in our eyes, is Mr. Tennyson&rsquo;s differentia, is really the
natural accompaniment of a quality at first sight its very opposite,
and for which he is often blamed by a prosaic world; namely, his subjective
and transcendental mysticism.&nbsp; It is the mystic, after all, who
will describe Nature most simply, because he sees most in her; because
he is most ready to believe that she will reveal to others the same
message which she has revealed to him.&nbsp; Men like Behmen, Novalis,
and Fourier, who can soar into the inner cloud-world of man&rsquo;s
spirit, even though they lose their way there, dazzled by excess of
wonder&mdash;men who, like Wordsworth, can give utterance to such subtle
anthropologic wisdom as the &ldquo;Ode on the Intimations of Immortality,&rdquo;
will for that very reason most humbly and patiently &ldquo;consider
the lilies of the field, how they grow.&rdquo;&nbsp; And even so it
is just because Mr. Tennyson is, far more than Wordsworth, mystical,
and what an ignorant and money-getting generation, idolatrous of mere
sensuous activity, calls &ldquo;dreamy,&rdquo; that he has become the
greatest naturalistic poet which England has seen for several centuries.&nbsp;
The same faculty which enabled him to draw such subtle subjective pictures
of womanhood as Adeline, Isabel, and Eleanor, enabled him to see, and
therefore simply to describe, in one of the most distinctive and successful
of his earlier poems, how</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>The creeping mosses and clambering weeds,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
the willow branches hoar and dank,<br />And the wavy swell of the soughing
reeds,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the wave-worn horns of the echoing
bank,<br />And the silvery marish flowers that throng<br />The desolate
creeks and pools among,<br />Were flooded over with eddying song.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>No doubt there are in the earlier poems exceptions to this style&mdash;attempts
to adorn nature, and dazzle with a barbaric splendour akin to that of
Keats&mdash;as, for instance, in the &ldquo;Recollections of the Arabian
Nights.&rdquo;&nbsp; But how cold and gaudy, in spite of individual
beauties, is that poem by the side of either of the Marianas, and especially
of the one in which the scenery is drawn, simply and faithfully, from
those counties which the world considers the quintessence of the prosaic&mdash;the
English fens.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Upon the middle of the night<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waking she heard
the night-fowl crow;<br />The cock sang out an hour ere light:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From
the dark fen the oxen&rsquo;s low<br />Came to her: without hope of
change,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In sleep she seemed to walk forlorn,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till
cold winds woke the gray-eyed morn<br />About the lonely moated grange.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>About a stone-cast from the wall<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sluice
with blackened waters slept,<br />And o&rsquo;er it many, round and
small,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cluster&rsquo;d marish-mosses crept.<br />Hard
by a poplar shook alway,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All silver-green with
gnarled bark,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For leagues no other tree did mark<br />The
level waste, the rounding gray,</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Throughout all these exquisite lines occurs but one instance of what
the vulgar call &ldquo;poetic diction.&rdquo;&nbsp; All is simple description,
in short and Saxon words, and yet who can deny the effect to be perfect&mdash;superior
to any similar passage in Wordsworth?&nbsp; And why?&nbsp; Because the
passage quoted, and indeed the whole poem, is perfect in what artists
call tone&mdash;tone in the metre and in the sound of the words, as
well as in the images and the feelings expressed.&nbsp; The weariness,
the dreariness, the dark mysterious waste, exist alike within and without,
in the slow monotonous pace of the metre and the words, as well as in
the boundless fen, and the heart of her who, &ldquo;without hope of
change, in sleep did seem to walk forlorn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The same faith in Nature, the same instinctive correctness in melody,
springing from that correct insight into Nature, ran through the poems
inspired by medieval legends.&nbsp; The very spirit of the old ballad
writers, with their combinations of mysticism and objectivity, their
freedom from any self-conscious attempt at reflective epithets or figures,
runs through them all.&nbsp; We are never jarred in them, as we are
in all the attempts at ballad-writing and ballad-restoring before Mr.
Tennyson&rsquo;s time, by discordant touches of the reflective in thought,
the picturesque in Nature, or the theatric in action.&nbsp; To illustrate
our meaning, readers may remember the ballad of &ldquo;Fair Emmeline,&rdquo;
in Bishop Percy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Reliques.&rdquo;&nbsp; The bishop confesses,
if we mistake not, to have patched one end of the ballad.&nbsp; He need
not have informed us of that fact, while such lines as these following
meet our eyes:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Baron turned aside,<br />And
wiped away the rising tears<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He proudly strove
to hide.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>No old ballad writer would have used such a complicated concetto.&nbsp;
Another, and even a worse instance is to be found in the difference
between the old and new versions of the grand ballad of &ldquo;Glasgerion.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In the original, we hear how the elfin harper could</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Harp fish out of the water,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And water out
of a stone,<br />And milk out of a maiden&rsquo;s breast<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That
bairn had never none.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>For which some benighted &ldquo;restorer&rdquo; substitutes&mdash;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Oh, there was magic in his touch,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sorcery
in his string!</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>No doubt there was.&nbsp; But while the new poetaster informs you
of the abstract notion, the ancient poet gives you the concrete fact;
as Mr. Tennyson has done with wonderful art in his exquisite &ldquo;St.
Agnes,&rdquo; where the saint&rsquo;s subjective mysticism appears only
as embodied in objective pictures:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Break up the heavens, oh Lord! and far<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through
all yon starlight keen<br />Draw me, thy bride, a glittering star,<br />In
raiment white and clean.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Sir Walter Scott&rsquo;s ballads fail just on the same point.&nbsp;
Even Campbell cannot avoid an occasional false note of sentiment.&nbsp;
In Mr. Tennyson alone, as we think, the spirit of the Middle Age is
perfectly reflected; its delight, not in the &ldquo;sublime and picturesque,&rdquo;
but in the green leaves and spring flowers for their own sake&mdash;the
spirit of Chaucer and of the &ldquo;Robin Hood Garland&rdquo;&mdash;the
naturalism which revels as much in the hedgerow and garden as in Alps,
and cataracts, and Italian skies, and the other strong stimulants to
the faculty of admiration which the palled taste of an unhealthy age,
from Keats and Byron down to Browning, has rushed abroad to seek.&nbsp;
It is enough for Mr. Tennyson&rsquo;s truly English spirit to see how</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>On either side the river lie<br />Long fields of barley and of rye,<br />That
clothe the wold and meet the sky;<br />And through the field the road
runs by<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To many-tower&rsquo;d
Camelot.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Or how</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>In the stormy east wind straining,<br />The pale yellow woods were
waning,<br />The broad stream in his banks complaining,<br />Heavily
the low sky raining<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over tower&rsquo;d
Camelot.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Give him but such scenery as that which he can see in every parish
in England, and he will find it a fit scene for an ideal myth, subtler
than a casuist&rsquo;s questionings, deep as the deepest heart of woman.</p>
<p>But in this earlier volume the poet has not yet arrived at the art
of combining his new speculations on man with his new mode of viewing
Nature.&nbsp; His objective pieces are too exclusively objective, his
subjective too exclusively subjective; and where he deals with natural
imagery in these latter, he is too apt, as in &ldquo;Eleanore,&rdquo;
to fall back upon the old and received method of poetic diction, though
he never indulges in a commonplace or a stock epithet.&nbsp; But in
the interval between 1830 and 1842 the needful interfusion of the two
elements has taken place.&nbsp; And in &ldquo;Locksley Hall&rdquo; and
the &ldquo;&lsquo;Two Voices&rdquo; we find the new doubts and questions
of the time embodied naturally and organically, in his own method of
simple natural expression.&nbsp; For instance, from the Search for Truth
in the &ldquo;Two Voices&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Cry, faint not, climb: the summits lope<br />Beyond the furthest
flights of hope,<br />Wrapt in dense cloud from base to cope.</p>
<p>Sometimes a little corner shines<br />As over rainy mist inclines<br />A
gleaming crag with belts of pines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will go forward,&rdquo; sayest thou;<br />&ldquo;I shall
not fail to find her now.<br />Look up, the fold is on her brow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Or again, in &ldquo;Locksley Hall,&rdquo; the poem which, as we think
deservedly, has had most influence on the minds of the young men of
our day:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Eager-hearted as a boy when first he leaves his father&rsquo;s field,<br />And
at night along the dusky highway near and nearer drawn,<br />Sees in
heaven the light of London flaring like a dreary dawn;<br />And his
spirit leaps within him to be gone before him then,<br />Underneath
the light he looks at, in among the throngs of men;<br />Men, my brothers,
men the workers, over reaping something new:<br />That which they have
done but earnest of the things which they shall do:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>and all the grand prophetic passage following, which is said, we
know not how truly, to have won for the poet the respect of that great
statesman whose loss all good men deplore.</p>
<p>In saying that &ldquo;Locksley Hall&rdquo; has deservedly had so
great an influence over the minds of the young, we shall, we are afraid,
have offended some who are accustomed to consider that poem as Werterian
and unhealthy.&nbsp; But, in reality, the spirit of the poem is simply
anti-Werterian.&nbsp; It is man rising out of sickness into health&mdash;not
conquered by Werterism, but conquering his selfish sorrow, and the moral
and intellectual paralysis which it produces, by faith and hope&mdash;faith
in the progress of science and civilisation, hope in the final triumph
of good.&nbsp; Doubtless, that is not the highest deliverance&mdash;not
a permanent deliverance at all.&nbsp; Faith in God and hope in Christ
alone can deliver a man once and for all from Werterism, or any other
moral disease; that truth was reserved for &ldquo;In Memoriam:&rdquo;
but as far as &ldquo;Locksley Hall&rdquo; goes, it is a step forward&mdash;a
whole moral &aelig;on beyond Byron and Shelley; and a step, too, in
the right direction, just because it is a step forward&mdash;because
the path of deliverance is, as &ldquo;Locksley Hall&rdquo; sets forth,
not backwards towards a fancied paradise of childhood&mdash;not backward
to grope after an unconsciousness which is now impossible, an implicit
faith which would be unworthy of the man, but forward on the road on
which God has been leading him, carrying upward with him the aspirations
of childhood, and the bitter experience of youth, to help the organised
and trustful labour of manhood.&nbsp; There are, in fact, only two deliverances
from Werterism possible in the nineteenth century; one is into Popery,
and the other is&mdash;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forward, forward, let us range;<br />Let the peoples
spin for ever down the ringing grooves of change;<br />Through the shadow
of the world we sweep into the younger day:<br />Better fifty years
of Europe than a cycle of Cathay.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>But such a combination of powers as Mr. Tennyson&rsquo;s naturally
develop themselves into a high idyllic faculty; for it is the very essence
of the idyl to set forth the poetry which lies in the simpler manifestations
of Man and Nature; yet not explicitly, by a reflective moralising on
them, as almost all our idyllists&mdash;Cowper, Gray, Crabbe, and Wordsworth&mdash;have
been in the habit of doing, but implicitly, by investing them all with
a rich and delightful tone of colouring, perfect grace of manner, perfect
melody of rhythm, which, like a gorgeous summer atmosphere, shall glorify
without altering the most trivial and homely sights.&nbsp; And it is
this very power, as exhibited in the &ldquo;Lord of Burleigh,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Audley Court,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Gardener&rsquo;s Daughter,&rdquo;
which has made Mr. Tennyson, not merely the only English rival of Theocritus
and Bion, but, in our opinion, as much their superior as modern England
is superior to ancient Greece.</p>
<p>Yet in &ldquo;The Princess,&rdquo; perhaps, Mr. Tennyson rises higher
still.&nbsp; The idyllic manner alternates with the satiric, the pathetic,
even the sublime, by such imperceptible gradations, and continual delicate
variations of key, that the harmonious medley of his style becomes the
fit outward expression of the bizarre and yet harmonious fairyland in
which his fancy ranges.&nbsp; In this work, too, Mr. Tennyson shows
himself more than ever the poet of the day.&nbsp; In it more than ever
the old is interpenetrated with the new&mdash;the domestic and scientific
with the ideal and sentimental.&nbsp; He dares, in every page, to make
use of modern words and notions, from which the mingled clumsiness and
archaism of his compeers shrinks, as unpoetical.&nbsp; Though, as we
just said, his stage is an ideal fairyland, yet he has reached the ideal
by the only true method&mdash;by bringing the Middle Age forward to
the Present one, and not by ignoring the Present to fall back on a cold
and galvanised Medievalism; and thus he makes his &ldquo;Medley&rdquo;
a mirror of the nineteenth century, possessed of its own new art and
science, its own new temptations and aspirations, and yet grounded on,
and continually striving to reproduce, the forms and experiences of
all past time.&nbsp; The idea, too, of &ldquo;The Princess&rdquo; is
an essentially modern one.&nbsp; In every age women have been tempted,
by the possession of superior beauty, intellect, or strength of will,
to deny their own womanhood, and attempt to stand alone as men, whether
on the ground of political intrigue, ascetic saintship, or philosophic
pride.&nbsp; Cleopatra and St. Hedwiga, Madame de Sta&euml;l and the
Princess, are merely different manifestations of the same self-willed
and proud longing of woman to unsex herself, and realise, single and
self-sustained, some distorted and partial notion of her own as to what
the &ldquo;angelic life&rdquo; should be.&nbsp; Cleopatra acted out
the pagan ideal of an angel; St. Hedwiga, the medieval one; Madame de
Sta&euml;l hers, with the peculiar notions of her time as to what &ldquo;spirituel&rdquo;
might mean; and in &ldquo;The Princess&rdquo; Mr. Tennyson has embodied
the ideal of that nobler, wider, purer, yet equally fallacious, because
equally unnatural, analogue, which we may meet too often up and down
England now.&nbsp; He shows us the woman, when she takes nor stand on
the false masculine ground of intellect, working out her own moral punishment,
by destroying in herself the tender heart of flesh: not even her vast
purposes of philanthropy can preserve her, for they are built up, not
on the womanhood which God has given her, but on her own self-will;
they change, they fall, they become inconsistent, even as she does herself,
till, at last, she loses all feminine sensibility; scornfully and stupidly
she rejects and misunderstands the heart of man; and then falling from
pride to sternness, from sternness to sheer inhumanity, she punishes
sisterly love as a crime, robs the mother of her child, and becomes
all but a vengeful fury, with all the peculiar faults of woman, and
none of the peculiar excellences of man.</p>
<p>The poem being, as its title imports, a medley of jest and earnest,
allows a metrical licence, of which we are often tempted to wish that
its author had not availed himself; yet the most unmetrical and apparently
careless passages flow with a grace, a lightness, a colloquial ease
and frolic, which perhaps only heighten the effect of the serious parts,
and serve as a foil to set off the unrivalled finish and melody of these
latter.&nbsp; In these come out all Mr. Tennyson&rsquo;s instinctive
choice of tone, his mastery of language, which always fits the right
word to the right thing, and that word always the simplest one, and
the perfect ear for melody which makes it superfluous to set to music
poetry which, read by the veriest schoolboy, makes music of itself.&nbsp;
The poem, we are glad to say, is so well known that it seems unnecessary
to quote from it; yet there are here and there gems of sound and expression
of which, however well our readers may know them, we cannot forbear
reminding them again.&nbsp; For instance, the end of the idyl in book
vii. beginning &ldquo;Come down, O maid&rdquo; (the whole of which is
perhaps one of the most perfect fruits of the poet&rsquo;s genius):</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Myriads of rivulets hurrying through the lawn,<br />The moan of doves
in immemorial elms,<br />And murmuring of innumerable bees.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Who, after three such lines, will talk of English as a harsh and
clumsy language, and seek in the effeminate and monotonous Italian for
expressive melody of sound?&nbsp; Who cannot hear in them the rapid
rippling of the water, the stately calmness of the wood-dove&rsquo;s
note, and, in the repetition of short syllables and soft liquids in
the last line, the</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Murmuring of innumerable bees?</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Or again, what combination of richness with simplicity in such a
passage as this:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breathe upon my brows;<br />In that fine air I
tremble, all the past<br />Melts mist-like into this bright hour, and
this<br />I scarce believe, and all the rich to come<br />Reels, as
the golden Autumn woodland reels<br />Athwart the smoke of burning leaves.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>How Mr. Tennyson can have attained the prodigal fulness of thought
and imagery which distinguishes this poem, and especially the last canto,
without his style ever becoming overloaded, seldom even confused, is
perhaps one of the greatest marvels of the whole production.&nbsp; The
songs themselves, which have been inserted between the cantos in the
last edition of the book, seem, perfect as they are, wasted and smothered
among the surrounding fertility; till we discover that they stand there,
not merely for the sake of their intrinsic beauty, but serve to call
back the reader&rsquo;s mind, at every pause in the tale of the Princess&rsquo;s
folly, to that very healthy ideal of womanhood which she has spurned.</p>
<p>At the end of the first canto, fresh from the description of the
female college, with its professoresses, and hostleresses, and other
utopian monsters, we turn the page, and&mdash;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>As through the land at eve we went,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pluck&rsquo;d
the ripen&rsquo;d ears.<br />We fell out, my wife and I,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
kissed again with tears:</p>
<p>And blessings on the falling-out<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That all
the more endears,<br />When we fall out with those we love,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
kiss again with tears!</p>
<p>For when we came where lies the child<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We lost
in other years,<br />There above the little grave,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
kissed again with tears.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Between the next two cantos intervenes the well-known cradle-song,
perhaps the best of all; and at the next interval is the equally well-known
bugle-song, the idea of which is that of twin-labour and twin-fame,
in a pair of lovers:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Our echoes roll from soul to soul,<br />And grow for ever and for
ever.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>In the next, the memory of wife and child inspirits the soldier in
the field; in the next, the sight of the fallen hero&rsquo;s child opens
the sluices of his widow&rsquo;s tears; and in the last, and perhaps
the most beautiful of all, the poet has succeeded, in the new edition,
in superadding a new form of emotion to a canto in which he seemed to
have exhausted every resource of pathos which his subject allowed; and
prepares us for the triumph of that art by which he makes us, after
all, love the heroine whom he at first taught us to hate and despise,
till we see that the naughtiness is after all one that must be kissed
and not whipped out of her, and look on smiling while she repents, with
Prince Harry of old, &ldquo;not in sackcloth and ashes, but in new silk
and old sack:&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Ask me no more: the moon may draw the sea;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
cloud may stoop from Heaven and take the shape,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With
fold to fold, of mountain or of cape;<br />But, O too fond, when have
I answered thee?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ask me no
more.</p>
<p>Ask me no more: what answer should I give?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
love not hollow cheek or faded eye:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, O my
friend, I will not have thee die!<br />Ask me no more, lest I should
bid thee live;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ask me no more.</p>
<p>Ask me no more: thy fate and mine are seal&rsquo;d:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
strove against the stream and all in vain:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let
the great river take me to the main:<br />No more, dear love, for at
a touch I yield;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ask me no
more.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>We now come to &ldquo;In Memoriam;&rdquo; a collection of poems on
a vast variety of subjects, but all united, as their name implies, to
the memory of a departed friend.&nbsp; We know not whether to envy more&mdash;the
poet the object of his admiration, or that object the monument which
has been consecrated to his nobleness.&nbsp; For in this latest and
highest volume, written at various intervals during a long series of
years, all the poet&rsquo;s peculiar excellences, with all that he has
acquired from others, seem to have been fused down into a perfect unity,
and brought to bear on his subject with that care and finish which only
a labour of love can inspire.&nbsp; We only now know the whole man,
all his art, all his insight, all his faculty of discerning the <i>pi&ugrave;
nell&rsquo; uno</i>, and the <i>uno nell&rsquo; pi&ugrave;</i>.&nbsp;
As he says himself:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>My love has talked with rocks and trees,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He
finds on misty mountain-ground,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His own vast
shadow glory-crowned;<br />He sees himself in all he sees.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Everything reminds him of the dead.&nbsp; Every joy or sorrow of
man, every aspect of nature, from</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>The forest crack&rsquo;d, the waters, curl&rsquo;d,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
cattle huddled on the lea.</p>
<p>The thousand waves of wheat<br />That ripple round the lonely grange.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>In every place where in old days they had met and conversed; in every
dark wrestling of the spirit with the doubts and fears of manhood, throughout
the whole outward universe of Nature, and the whole inward universe
of spirit, the soul of his dead friend broods&mdash;at first a memory
shrouded in blank despair, then, a living presence, a ministering spirit,
answering doubts, calming fears, stirring up noble aspirations, utter
humility, leading the poet upward, step by step, to faith, and peace,
and hope.&nbsp; Not that there runs throughout the book a conscious
or organic method.&nbsp; The poems seem often merely to be united by
the identity of their metre, so exquisitely chosen, that while the major
rhyme in the second and third lines of each stanza gives the solidity
and self-restraint required by such deep themes, the mournful minor
rhyme of each first and fourth line always leads the ear to expect something
beyond, and enables the poet&rsquo;s thoughts to wander sadly on, from
stanza to stanza and poem to poem, in an endless chain of</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Link&egrave;d sweetness long drawn out.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>There are records of risings and fallings again, of alternate cloud
and sunshine, throughout the book; earnest and passionate, yet never
bitter; humble, yet never abject; with a depth and vehemence of affection
&ldquo;passing the love of woman,&rdquo; yet without a taint of sentimentality;
self-restrained and dignified, without ever narrowing into artificial
coldness; altogether rivalling the sonnets of Shakespeare; and all knit
together into one spiritual unity by the proem at the opening of the
volume&mdash;in our eyes, the noblest English Christian poem which several
centuries have seen.</p>
<p>We shall not quote the very poems which we should most wish to sink
into men&rsquo;s hearts.&nbsp; Let each man find for himself those which
suit him best, and meditate on them in silence.&nbsp; They are fit only
to be read solemnly in our purest and most thoughtful moods, in the
solitude of our chamber, or by the side of those we love, with thanks
to the great heart who has taken courage to bestow on us the record
of his own friendship, doubt, and triumph.</p>
<p>It has been often asked why Mr. Tennyson&rsquo;s great and varied
powers had never been concentrated on one immortal work.&nbsp; The epic,
the lyric, the idyllic faculties, perhaps the dramatic also, seemed
to be all there, and yet all sundered, scattered about in small fragmentary
poems.&nbsp; &ldquo;In Memoriam,&rdquo; as we think, explains the paradox.&nbsp;
Mr. Tennyson had been employed on higher, more truly divine, and yet
more truly human work than either epos or drama.&nbsp; Within the unseen
and alone truly Real world which underlies and explains this mere time-shadow,
which men miscall the Real, he had been going down into the depths,
and ascending into the heights, led, like Dante of old, by the guiding
of a mighty spirit.&nbsp; And in this volume, the record of seventeen
years, we have the result of those spiritual experiences in a form calculated,
as we believe, to be a priceless benefit to many an earnest seeker in
this generation, and perhaps to stir up some who are priding themselves
on a cold dilettantism and barren epicurism, into something like a living
faith and hope.&nbsp; Blessed and delightful it is to find, that even
in these new ages the creeds which so many fancy to be at their last
gasp, are still the final and highest succour, not merely of the peasant
and the outcast, but of the subtle artist and the daring speculator.&nbsp;
Blessed it is to find the most cunning poet of our day able to combine
the complicated rhythm and melody of modern times with the old truths
which gave heart to martyrs at the stake; and to see in the science
and the history of the nineteenth century new and living fulfilments
of the words which we learnt at our mother&rsquo;s knee.&nbsp; Blessed,
thrice blessed, to find that hero-worship is not yet passed away; that
the heart of man still beats young and fresh; that the old tales of
David and Jonathan, Damon and Pythias, Socrates and Alcibiades, Shakespeare
and his nameless friend, of &ldquo;love passing the love of woman,&rdquo;
ennobled by its own humility, deeper than death, and mightier than the
grave, can still blossom out, if it be but in one heart here and there,
to show men still how, sooner or later, &ldquo;he that loveth knoweth
God, for God is love.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>BURNS AND HIS SCHOOL <a name="citation127"></a><a href="#footnote127">{127}</a></h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Four faces among the portraits of modern men, great or small, strike
us as supremely beautiful; not merely in expression, but in the form
and proportion and harmony of features: Shakespeare, Raffaelle, Goethe,
Burns.&nbsp; One would expect it to be so; for the mind makes the body,
not the body the mind; and the inward beauty seldom fails to express
itself in the outward, as a visible sign of the invisible grace or disgrace
of the wearer.&nbsp; Not that it is so always.&nbsp; A Paul, Apostle
of the Gentiles, may be ordained to be &ldquo;in presence weak, in speech
contemptible,&rdquo; hampered by some thorn in the flesh&mdash;to interfere
apparently with the success of his mission, perhaps for the same wise
purpose of Providence which sent Socrates to the Athenians, the worshippers
of physical beauty, in the ugliest of human bodies, that they, or rather
those of them to whom eyes to see had been given, might learn, that
soul is after all independent of matter, and not its creature and its
slave.&nbsp; But, in the generality of cases, physiognomy is a sound
and faithful science, and tells us, if not, alas! what the man might
have been, still what he has become.&nbsp; Yet even this former problem,
what he might have been, may often be solved for us by youthful portraits,
before sin and sorrow and weakness have had their will upon the features;
and, therefore, when we spoke of these four beautiful faces, we alluded,
in each case, to the earliest portraits of each genius which we could
recollect.&nbsp; Placing them side by side, we must be allowed to demand
for that of Robert Burns an honourable station among them.&nbsp; Of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s we do not speak, for it seems to us to combine in
itself the elements of all the other three; but of the rest, we question
whether Burns be not, after all, if not the noblest, still the most
lovable&mdash;the most like what we should wish that of a teacher of
men to be.&nbsp; Raffaelle&mdash;the most striking portrait of him,
perhaps, is the full-face pencil sketch by his own hand in the Taylor
Gallery at Oxford&mdash;though without a taint of littleness or effeminacy,
is soft, melancholy, formed entirely to receive and to elaborate in
silence.&nbsp; His is a face to be kissed, not worshipped.&nbsp; Goethe,
even in his earliest portraits, looks as if his expression depended
too much on his own will.&nbsp; There is a self-conscious power, and
purpose, and self-restraint, and all but scorn, upon those glorious
lineaments, which might win worship, and did; but not love, except as
the child of enthusiasm or of relationship.&nbsp; But Burns&rsquo;s
face, to judge of it by the early portrait of him by Nasmyth, must have
been a face like that of Joseph of old, of whom the Rabbis relate, that
he was mobbed by the Egyptian ladies whenever he walked the streets.&nbsp;
The magic of that countenance, making Burns at once tempter and tempted,
may explain many a sad story.&nbsp; The features certainly are not perfectly
regular; there is no superabundance of the charm of mere animal health
in the outline or colour: but the marks of intellectual beauty in the
face are of the highest order, capable of being but too triumphant among
a people of deep thought and feeling.&nbsp; The lips, ripe, yet not
coarse or loose, full of passion and the faculty of enjoyment, are parted,
as if forced to speak by the inner fulness of the heart; the features
are rounded, rich, and tender, and yet the bones show thought massively
and manfully everywhere; the eyes laugh out upon you with boundless
good humour and sweetness, with simple, eager, gentle surprise&mdash;a
gleam as of the morning star, looking forth upon the wonder of a new-born
world&mdash;altogether</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>A station like the herald Mercury,<br />New lighted on a heaven-kissing
hill.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Bestow on such a man the wittiest and most winning eloquence&mdash;a
rich flow of spirits and fulness of health and life&mdash;a deep sense
of wonder and beauty in the earth and man&mdash;an instinct of the dynamic
and supernatural laws which underlie and vivify this material universe
and its appearances, healthy, yet irregular and unscientific, all but
superstitious&mdash;turn him loose in any country in Europe, during
the latter half of the eighteenth century, and it will not be difficult,
alas! to cast his horoscope.</p>
<p>And what an age in which to be turned loose!&mdash;for loose he must
go, to solve the problem of existence for himself.&nbsp; The grand simple
old Scottish education which he got from his parents must prove narrow
and unsatisfying for so rich and manifold a character; not because it
was in itself imperfect; not because it did not contain implicitly all
things necessary for his &ldquo;salvation&rdquo;&mdash;in every sense,
all laws which he might require for his after-life guidance; but because
it contained so much of them as yet only implicitly; because it was
not yet conscious of its own breadth and depth, and power of satisfying
the new doubts and cravings of such minds and such times as Burns&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
It may be that Burns was the devoted victim by whose fall it was to
be taught that it must awaken and expand and renew its youth in shapes
equally sound, but more complex and scientific.&nbsp; But it had not
done so then.&nbsp; And when Burns found himself gradually growing beyond
his father&rsquo;s teaching in one direction, and tempted beyond it
in another and a lower one, what was there in those times to take up
his education at the point where it had been left unfinished?&nbsp;
He saw around him in plenty animal good-nature and courage, barbaric
honesty and hospitality&mdash;more, perhaps, than he would see now;
for the upward progress into civilised excellences is sure to be balanced
by some loss of savage ones&mdash;but reckless, shallow, above all,
drunken.&nbsp; It was a hard-drinking, coarse, materialist age.&nbsp;
The higher culture, of Scotland especially, was all but exclusively
French&mdash;not a good kind, while Voltaire and Volney still remained
unanswered, and &ldquo;Les Liaisons Dangereuses&rdquo; were accepted
by all young gentlemen, and a great many young ladies who could read
French, as the best account of the relation of the sexes.</p>
<p>Besides, the philosophy of that day, like its criticism, was altogether
mechanical, nay, as it now seems, materialist in its ultimate and logical
results.&nbsp; Criticism was outward, and of the form merely.&nbsp;
The world was not believed to be already, and in itself, mysterious
and supernatural, and the poet was not defined as the man who could
see and proclaim that supernatural element.&nbsp; Before it was admired,
it was to be raised above nature into the region of &ldquo;the picturesque,&rdquo;
or whatnot; and the poet was the man who gave it this factitious and
superinduced beauty, by a certain &ldquo;kompsologia&rdquo; and &ldquo;meteoroepeia,&rdquo;
called &ldquo;poetic diction,&rdquo; now happily becoming extinct, mainly,
we believe, under the influence of Burns, although he himself thought
it his duty to bedizen his verses therewith, and though it was destined
to flourish for many a year more in the temple of the father of lies,
like a jar of paper flowers on a Popish altar.</p>
<p>No wonder that in such a time, a genius like Burns should receive
not only no guidance, but no finer appreciation.&nbsp; True; he was
admired, petted, flattered; for that the man was wonderful no one could
doubt.&nbsp; But we question whether he was understood; whether, if
that very flowery and magniloquent style which we now consider his great
failing had been away, he would not have been passed over by the many
as a writer of vulgar doggrel.&nbsp; True, the old simple ballad-muse
of Scotland still dropped a gem from her treasures, here and there,
even in the eighteenth century itself&mdash;witness &ldquo;Auld Robin
Gray.&rdquo;&nbsp; But who suspected that they were gems, of which Scotland,
fifty years afterwards, would be prouder and more greedy than of all
the second-hand French culture which seemed to her then the highest
earthly attainment?&nbsp; The Review of Burns in an early number of
the &ldquo;Edinburgh Review,&rdquo; said to be from the pen of the late
Lord Jeffrey, shows, as clearly as anything can, the utterly inconsistent
and bewildered feeling with which the world must have regarded such
a phenomenon.&nbsp; Alas! there was inconsistency and bewilderment enough
in the phenomenon itself, but that only made confusion worse confounded;
the confusion was already there, even in the mind of the more practical
literary men, who ought, one would have thought, also to have been the
most deep-sighted.&nbsp; But no.&nbsp; The reviewer turns the strange
thing over and over, and inside out&mdash;and some fifteen years after
it has vanished out of the world, having said out its say and done all
that it had to do, he still finds it too utterly abnormal to make up
his mind about in any clear or consistent way, and gets thoroughly cross
with it, and calls it hard names, because it will not fit into any established
pigeon-hole or drawer of the then existing anthropological museum.&nbsp;
Burns is &ldquo;a literary prodigy,&rdquo; and yet it is &ldquo;a derogation&rdquo;
to him to consider him as one.&nbsp; And that we find, not as we should
have expected, because he possessed genius, which would have made success
a matter of course in any rank, but because he was so well educated&mdash;&ldquo;having
acquired a competent knowledge of French, together with the elements
of Latin and Geometry,&rdquo; and before he had composed a single stanza,
was &ldquo;far more intimately acquainted with Pope, Shakespeare, and
Thomson, than nine-tenths of the youths who leave school for the university,&rdquo;
etc. etc.&mdash;in short, because he was so well educated, that his
becoming Robert Burns, the immortal poet, was a matter of course and
necessity.&nbsp; And yet, a page or two on, the great reason why it
was more easy for Robert Burns the cottar to become an original and
vigorous poet, rather than for any one of &ldquo;the herd of scholars
and academical literati,&rdquo; who are depressed and discouraged by
&ldquo;perusing the most celebrated writers, and conversing with the
most intelligent judges,&rdquo; is found to be, that &ldquo;the literature
and refinement of the age do not exist for a rustic and illiterate individual;
and consequently the present time is to him what the rude times of old
were to the vigorous writer who adorned them.&rdquo;&nbsp; In short
the great reason of Robert Burns&rsquo;s success was that he did not
possess that education the possession of which proves him to be no prodigy,
though the review begins by calling him one, and coupling him with Stephen
Duck and Thomas Dermody.</p>
<p>Now if the best critic of the age, writing fifteen years after Burns&rsquo;s
death, found himself between the horns of such a dilemma&rsquo;&mdash;which
indeed, like those of an old Arnee bull, meet at the points, and form
a complete circle of contradictions&mdash;what must have been the bewilderment
of lesser folk during the prodigy&rsquo;s very lifetime? what must,
indeed, have been his own bewilderment at himself, however manfully
he may have kept it down?&nbsp; No wonder that he was unguided, either
by himself or by others.&nbsp; We do not blame them; him we must deeply
blame; yet not as we ought to blame ourselves, did we yield in the least
to those temptations under which Burns fell.</p>
<p>Biographies of Burns, and those good ones, according to the standard
of biographies in these days, are said to exist; we cannot say that
we have as yet cared to read them.&nbsp; There are several other biographies,
even more important, to be read first, when they are written.&nbsp;
Shakespeare has found as yet no biographer; has not even left behind
him materials for a biography, such at least as are considered worth
using.&nbsp; Indeed, we question whether such a biography would be of
any use whatever to the world; for the man who cannot, by studying his
dramas in some tolerably accurate chronological order, and using as
a running accompaniment and closet commentary those awe-inspiring sonnets
of his, attain to some clear notion of what sort of life William Shakespeare
must have led, would not see him much the clearer for many folios of
anecdote.&nbsp; For after all, the best biography of every sincere man
is sure to be his own works; here he has set down, &ldquo;transferred
as in a figure,&rdquo; all that has happened to him, inward or outward,
or rather, all which has formed him, produced a permanent effect upon
his mind and heart; and knowing that, you know all you need know, and
are content, being glad to escape the personality and gossip of names
and places, and of dates even, except in as far as they enable you to
place one step of his mental growth before or after another.&nbsp; Of
the honest man this holds true always; and almost always of the dishonest
man, the man of cant, affectation, hypocrisy; for even if he pretend
in his novel or his poem to be what he is not, he still shows you thereby
what he thinks he ought to have been, or at least what he thinks that
the world thinks he ought to have been, and confesses to you, in the
most na&iuml;ve and confidential way, like one who talks in his sleep,
what learning he has or has not had; what society he has or has not
seen, and that in the very act of trying to prove the contrary.&nbsp;
Nay, the smaller the man or woman, and the less worth deciphering his
biography, the more surely will he show you, if you have eyes to see
and time to look, what sort of people offended him twenty years ago;
what meanness he would have liked &ldquo;to indulge in,&rdquo; if he
had dared, when young, and for what other meanness he relinquished it,
as he grew up; of what periodical he stood in awe when he took pen in
hand, and so forth.&nbsp; Whether his books treat of love or political
economy, theology or geology, it is there, the history of the man legibly
printed, for those who care to read it.&nbsp; In these poems and letters
of Burns, we apprehend, is to be found a truer history than any anecdote
can supply, of the things which happened to himself, and moreover of
the most notable things which went on in Scotland between 1759 and 1796.</p>
<p>This latter assertion may seem startling, when we consider that we
find in these poems no mention whatsoever of the discoveries of steamboats
and spinning-jennies, the rise of the great manufacturing cities, the
revolution in Scottish agriculture, or even in Scottish metaphysics.&nbsp;
But after all, the history of a nation is the history of the men, and
not of the things thereof; and the history of those men is the history
of their hearts, and not of their purses, or even of their heads; and
the history of one man who has felt in himself the heart experiences
of his generation, and anticipated many belonging to the next generation,
is so far the collective history of that generation, and of much&mdash;no
man can say how much&mdash;of the next generation; and such a man, bearing
within his single soul two generations of working-men, we take Robert
Burns to have been; and his poems, as such, a contemporaneous history
of Scotland, the equal to which we are not likely to see written for
this generation, or several to come.</p>
<p>Such a man sent out into such an age, would naturally have a hard
and a confused battle to fight, would probably, unless he fell under
the guidance of some master-mind, end se ipso minor, stunted and sadly
deformed, as Burns did.&nbsp; His works are after all only the disjecta
membra poet&aelig;; full of hints of a great might-have-been.&nbsp;
Hints of the keenest and most dramatic appreciation of human action
and thought.&nbsp; Hints of an unbounded fancy, playing gracefully in
the excess of its strength, with the vastest images, as in that robe
of the Scottish Muse, in which</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Deep lights and shades, bold mingling, threw<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
lustre grand,<br />And seem&rsquo;d to my astonished view<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
well-known land.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>The image, and the next few stanzas which dilate it, might be a translation
from Dante&rsquo;s &ldquo;Paradiso,&rdquo; so broad, terse, vivid, the
painter&rsquo;s touch.&nbsp; Hints, too, of a humour, which, like that
of Shakespeare, rises at times by sheer depth of insight into the sublime;
as when</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Hornie did the Laigh Kirk watch<br />Just like a winking baudrons.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Hints of a power of verbal wit, which, had it been sharpened in such
a perpetual word-battle as that amid which Shakespeare lived from the
age of twenty, might have rivalled Shakespeare&rsquo;s own; which even
now asserts its force by a hundred little never-to-be-forgotten phrases
scattered through his poems, which stick, like barbed arrows, in the
memory of every reader.&nbsp; And as for his tenderness&mdash;the quality
without which all other poetic excellence is barren&mdash;it gushes
forth toward every creature, animate and inanimate, with one exception,
namely, the hypocrite, ever alike &ldquo;spiacente a Dio e ai nemici
sui;&rdquo; and therefore intolerable to Robert Burns&rsquo;s honesty,
whether he be fighting for or against the cause of right.&nbsp; Again
we say, there are evidences of a versatile and manifold faculty in this
man, which, with a stronger will and a larger education, might have
placed him as an equal by the side of those great names which we mentioned
together with his at the commencement of this article.</p>
<p>But one thing Burns wanted; and of that one thing his age helped
to deprive him&mdash;the education which comes by reverence.&nbsp; Looking
round in such a time, with his keen power of insight, his keen sense
of humour, what was there to worship?&nbsp; Lord Jeffrey, or whosoever
was the author of the review in the &ldquo;Edinburgh,&rdquo; says disparagingly,
that Burns had as much education as Shakespeare.&nbsp; So he very probably
had, if education mean book-learning.&nbsp; Nay, more, of the practical
education of the fireside, the sober, industrious, God-fearing education,
and &ldquo;drawing out&rdquo; of the manhood, by act and example, Burns
may have had more under his good father than Shakespeare under his;
though the family life of the small English burgher in Elizabeth&rsquo;s
time would have generally presented, as we suspect, the very same aspect
of staid manfulness and godliness which a Scotch farmer&rsquo;s did
fifty years ago.&nbsp; But let that be as it may, Burns was not born
into an Elizabethan age.&nbsp; He did not see around him Raleighs and
Sidneys, Cecils and Hookers, Drakes and Frobishers, Spensers and Jonsons,
Southamptons and Willoughbys, with an Elizabeth, guiding and moulding
the great whole, a crowned Titaness, terrible, and strong, and wise&mdash;a
woman who, whether right or wrong, bowed the proudest, if not to love,
yet still to obey.</p>
<p>That was the secret of Shakespeare&rsquo;s power.&nbsp; Heroic himself,
he was born into an age of heroes.&nbsp; You see it in his works.&nbsp;
Not a play but gives patent evidence that to him all forms of human
magnanimity were common and wayside flowers&mdash;among the humours
of men which he and Ben Jonson used to wander forth together to observe.&nbsp;
And thus he could give living action and speech to the ancient noblenesses
of Rome and the Middle Age; for he had walked and conversed with them,
unchanged in everything but in the dress.&nbsp; Had he known Greek literature
he could have recalled to imperishable life such men as Cimon and Aristides,
such deeds as Marathon and Salamis.&nbsp; For had we not had our own
Salamis acted within a few years of his birth; and were not the heroes
of it still walking among men?&nbsp; It was surely this continual presence
of &ldquo;men of worship,&rdquo; this atmosphere of admiration and respect
and trust, in which Shakespeare must have lived, which tamed down the
wild self-will of the deer-stealing fugitive from Stratford, into the
calm large-eyed philosopher, tolerant and loving, and full of faith
in a species made in the likeness of God.&nbsp; Not so with Burns.&nbsp;
One feels painfully in his poems the want of great characters; and still
more painfully that he has not drawn them, simply because they were
not there to draw.&nbsp; That he has a true eye for what is noble, when
he sees it, let his &ldquo;Lament for Glencairn&rdquo; testify, and
the stanzas in his &ldquo;Vision,&rdquo; in which, with a high-bred
grace which many a courtly poet of his day might have envied, he alludes
to one and another Scottish worthy of his time.&nbsp; There is no vein
of saucy and envious &ldquo;banausia&rdquo; in the man; even in his
most graceless sneer, his fault&mdash;if fault it be&mdash;is, that
he cannot and will not pretend to respect that which he knows to be
unworthy of respect.&nbsp; He sees around him and above him, as well
as below him, an average of men and things dishonest, sensual, ungodly,
shallow, ridiculous by reason of their own lusts and passions, and he
will not apply to the shams of dignity and worth, the words which were
meant for their realities.&nbsp; After all, he does but say what every
one round him was feeling and thinking; but he said it; and hypocritical
respectability shrank shrieking from the mirror of her own inner heart.&nbsp;
But it was all the worse for him.&nbsp; In the sins of others he saw
an excuse for his own.&nbsp; Losing respect for and faith in his brother-men,
he lost, as a matter of course, respect for himself, faith in himself.&nbsp;
The hypocrisy which persecutes in the name of law, whether political
or moral, while in private it transgresses the very law which is for
ever on its tongue, is turned by his passionate and sorely-tempted character
into a too easy excuse for disbelieving in the obligation of any law
whatsoever.&nbsp; He ceases to worship, and therefore to be himself
worshipful&mdash;and we know the rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He might have still worshipped God?&rdquo;&nbsp; He might,
and surely amid all his sins, doubts, and confusions, the remembrance
of the old faith learned at his parent&rsquo;s knee, does haunt him
still as a beautiful regret&mdash;and sometimes, in his bitterest hours,
shine out before his poor broken heart as an everlasting Pharos, lighting
him homewards after all.&nbsp; Whether he reached that home or not,
none on earth can tell.&nbsp; But his writings show, if anything can,
that the vestal-fire of conscience still burned within, though choked
again and again with bitter ashes and foul smoke.&nbsp; Consider the
time in which he lived, when it was &ldquo;as with the people, so with
the priest,&rdquo; and the grand old life-tree of the Scottish Kirk,
now green and vigorous with fresh leaves and flowers, was all crusted
with foul scurf and moss, and seemed to have ceased growing, and to
be crumbling down into decay; consider the terrible contradiction between
faith and practice which must have met the eyes of the man, before he
could write with the same pen&mdash;and one as honestly as the other&mdash;&ldquo;The
Cottar&rsquo;s Saturday Night,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Holy Willie&rsquo;s
Prayer.&rdquo;&nbsp; But those times are past, and the men who acted
in them gone to another tribunal.&nbsp; Let the dead bury their dead;
and, in the meantime, instead of cursing the misguided genius, let us
consider whether we have not also something for which to thank him;
whether, as competent judges of him aver from their own experience,
those very seeming blasphemies of his have not produced more good than
evil; whether, though &ldquo;a savour of death unto death,&rdquo; to
conceited and rebellious spirits, they may not have helped to open the
eyes of the wise to the extent to which the general eighteenth-century
rottenness had infected Scotland, and to make intolerable a state of
things which ought to have been intolerable, even if Burns had never
written.</p>
<p>We are not attacking the reviewer, far less the &ldquo;Edinburgh
Review,&rdquo; which some years after this not only made the amende
honorable to Burns, but showed a frank impartiality only too rare in
the reviews of these days, by publishing in its pages the noble article
on Burns which has since appeared separately in Mr. Carlyle&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Miscellanies.&rdquo;&nbsp; We only wish to show, from the reviewer&rsquo;s
own words, the element in which Burns had to work, the judges before
whom he had to plead, and the change which, as we think, very much by
the influence of his own poems, has passed upon the minds of men.&nbsp;
How few are there who would pen now about him such a sentence as this:
&ldquo;He is&rdquo; (that is, was, having gone to his account fifteen
years before) &ldquo;perpetually making a parade of his own inflammability
and imprudence, and talking with much self-complacency and exultation
of the offence he has occasioned to the sober and correct part of mankind&rdquo;&mdash;a
very small part of mankind, one would have thought, in the British Isles
at least, about the end of the last century.&nbsp; But, it was the fashion
then, as usual, to substitute the praise of virtues for the practice
of them; and three-bottle and ten-tumbler men had a very good right,
of course, to admire sobriety and correctness, and to denounce any two-bottle
and six-tumbler man who was not ashamed to confess in print the weaknesses
which they confessed only by word of mouth.&nbsp; Just, and yet not
just.&nbsp; True, Burns does make a parade of his thoughtlessness, and
worse; but why? because he gloried in it?&nbsp; He must be a very skin-deep
critic who cannot see, even in the most insolent of those blameworthy
utterances, an inward shame and self-reproach, which if any man had
ever felt in himself, he would be in nowise inclined to laugh at it
in others.&nbsp; Why, it is the very shame which wrings those poems
out of him.&nbsp; They are the attempt of the strong man fettered to
laugh at his own consciousness of slavery&mdash;to deny the existence
of his chains&mdash;to pretend to himself that he likes them.&nbsp;
To us, some of those wildest &ldquo;Rob the Ranter&rdquo; bursts of
blackguardism are most deeply mournful, hardly needing that the sympathies
which they stir up should be heightened by the little scraps of prayer
and bitter repentance, which lie up and down among their uglier brethren,
the disjecta membra of a great &ldquo;De Profundis,&rdquo; perhaps not
all unheard.&nbsp; These latter pieces are most significant.&nbsp; The
very doggrel of them, the total absence of any attempt at ornament in
diction or polish in metre, is proof complete of their deep heart-wrung
sincerity.&nbsp; They are like the wail of a lost child, rather than
the remorse of a Titan.&nbsp; The heart of the man was so young to the
last; the boy-vein in him, as perhaps in all great poets, beating on
through manhood for good and for evil.&nbsp; No! there was parade there,
as of the lost woman, who tries to hide her self-disgust by staring
you out of countenance, but of complacency and exultation none.</p>
<p>On one point, namely politics, Burns&rsquo;s higher sympathies seem
to have been awakened.&nbsp; It had been better for him, in a worldly
point of view, that they had not.&nbsp; In an intellectual, and even
in a moral point of view, far worse.&nbsp; A fellow-feeling with the
French Revolution, in the mind of a young man of that day, was a sign
of moral health, which we should have been sorry to miss in him.&nbsp;
Unable to foresee the outcome of the great struggle, having lost faith
in those everlasting truths, religious and political, which it was madly
setting at naught, what could it appear to him but an awakening from
the dead, a return to young and genial health, a purifying thunderstorm.&nbsp;
Such was his dream, the dream of thousands more, and not so wrong a
one after all.&nbsp; For that, since that fearful outburst of the nether
pit, all Europe has arisen and awakened into manifold and beautiful
new life, who can deny?&nbsp; We are not what we were, but better, or
rather, with boundless means of being better if we will.&nbsp; We have
entered a fresh era of time for good and evil; the fact is patent in
every sermon we hear, in every book we read, in every invention, even
the most paltry, which we see registered.&nbsp; Shall we think hardly
of the man who saw the dawn of our own day, and welcomed it cheerfully
and hopefully, even though he fancied the mist-spectres to be elements
of the true sunrise, and knew not&mdash;and who knows?&mdash;the purposes
of Him whose paths are in the great deep, and His ways past finding
out?&nbsp; At least, the greater part of his influence on the times
which have followed him, is to be ascribed to that very &ldquo;Radicalism&rdquo;
which in the eyes of the respectable around him, had sealed his doom,
and consigned him to ignoble oblivion.&nbsp; It has been, with the working
men who read him, a passport for the rest of his writings; it has allured
them to listen to him, when he spoke of high and holy things, which
but for him, they might have long ago tossed away as worthless, in the
recklessness of ignorance and discontent.&nbsp; They could trust his
&ldquo;Cottar&rsquo;s Saturday Night;&rdquo; they could believe that
he spoke from his heart, when in deep anguish he cries to the God whom
he had forgotten, while they would have turned with a distrustful sneer
from the sermon of the sleek and comfortable minister, who in their
eyes, however humbly born, had deserted his class, and gone over to
the camp of the enemy, and the flesh-pots of Egypt.</p>
<p>After the time of Burns, as was to be expected, Scottish song multiplies
itself tenfold.&nbsp; The nation becomes awakened to the treasures of
its own old literature, and attempts, what after all, alas! is but a
revival; and like most revivals, not altogether a successful one.&nbsp;
Of the twelve hundred songs contained in Mr. Whitelaw&rsquo;s excellent
collection, whereof more than a hundred and fifty are either wholly
or partly Burns&rsquo;s, the small proportion written before him are
decidedly far superior in value to those written after him; a discouraging
fact, though not difficult to explain, if we consider the great social
changes which have been proceeding, the sterner subjects of thought
which have been arising, during the last half-century.&nbsp; True song
requires for its atmosphere a state rather of careless Arcadian prosperity,
than of struggle and doubt, of earnest looking forward to an unknown
future, and pardonable regret for a dying past; and in that state the
mind of the masses, throughout North Britain, has been weltering confusedly
for the last few years.&nbsp; The new and more complex era into which
we are passing has not yet sufficiently opened itself to be sung about;
men hardly know what it is, much less what it will be; and while they
are hard at work creating it, they have no breath to spare in talking
of it.&nbsp; One thing they do see and feel, painfully enough at times,
namely, that the old Scottish pastoral life is passing away, before
the combined influence of manufactures and the large-farm system; to
be replaced, doubtless, hereafter, by something better, but in the meanwhile
dragging down with it in its decay but too much that can ill be spared
of that old society which inspired Ramsay and Burns.&nbsp; Hence the
later Scottish song-writers seldom really sing; their proses want the
unconscious lilt and flash of their old models; they will hardly go
(the true test of a song) without music.&nbsp; The true test, we say
again, of a song.&nbsp; Who needs music, however fitting and beautiful
the accustomed air may happen to be, to &ldquo;Roy&rsquo;s Wife of Aldivalloch,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;The Bride cam&rsquo; out o&rsquo; the byre,&rdquo; or either
of the casts of &ldquo;The Flowers of the Forest,&rdquo; or to &ldquo;Auld
Lang Syne&rdquo; itself?&nbsp; They bubble right up out of the heart,
and by virtue of their inner and unconscious melody, which all that
is true to the heart has in it, shape themselves into a song, and are
not shaped by any notes whatsoever.&nbsp; So with many, most indeed,
of Burns&rsquo;s; and a few of Allan Cunningham&rsquo;s; the &ldquo;Wet
sheet and a flowing sail,&rdquo; for instance.&nbsp; But the great majority
of these later songs seem, if the truth is to be spoken, inspirations
at second hand, of people writing about things which they would like
to feel, and which they ought to feel, because others used to feel them
in old times; but which they do not feel as their forefathers felt&mdash;a
sort of poetical Tractarianism, in short.&nbsp; Their metre betrays
them, as well as their words; in both they are continually wandering,
unconsciously to themselves, into the elegiac&mdash;except when on one
subject, whereon the muse of Scotia still warbles at first hand, and
from the depths of her heart&mdash;namely, alas! the barley bree: and
yet never, even on this beloved theme, has she risen again to the height
of Burns&rsquo;s bacchanalian songs.</p>
<p>But when sober, there is a sadness about the Scottish muse nowadays&mdash;as
perhaps there ought to be&mdash;and the utterances of hers which ring
the truest are laments.&nbsp; We question whether in all Mr. Whitelaw&rsquo;s
collection there is a single modern poem (placing Burns as the transition
point between the old and new) which rises so high, or pierces so deep,
with all its pastoral simplicity, as Smibert&rsquo;s &ldquo;Widow&rsquo;s
Lament.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Afore the Lammas tide<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had dwin&rsquo;d the

<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>It seems strange why the man who could write this, who shows, in
the minor key of metre, which he has so skilfully chosen, such an instinct
for the true music of words, could not have written much more.&nbsp;
And yet, perhaps, we have ourselves given the reason already.&nbsp;
There was not much more to sing about.&nbsp; The fashion of imitating
old Jacobite songs is past, the mine now being exhausted, to the great
comfort of sincerity and common sense.&nbsp; The peasantry, whose courtship,
rich in animal health, yet not over pure and refined, Allan Ramsay sang
a hundred years ago, are learning to think, and act, and emigrate, as
well as to make love.&nbsp; The age of Theocritus and Bion has given
place to&mdash;shall we say the age of the C&aelig;sars, or the irruption
of the barbarians?&mdash;and the love-singers of the North are beginning
to feel, that if that passion is to retain any longer its rightful place
in their popular poetry, it must be spoken of henceforth in words as
lofty and refined as those in which the most educated and the most gifted
speak of it.&nbsp; Hence, in the transition between the old animalism
and the new spiritualism, a jumble of the two elements, not always felicitous;
attempts at ambitious description, after Burns&rsquo;s worst manner;
at subjective sentiment, after the worst manner of the world in general;
and yet, all the while, a consciousness that there was something worth
keeping in the simple objective style of the old school, without which
the new thoughtfulness would be hollow, and barren, and windy; and so
the two are patched together, &ldquo;new cloth into an old garment,
making the rent worse.&rdquo;&nbsp; Accordingly, these new songs are
universally troubled with the disease of epithets.&nbsp; Ryan&rsquo;s
exquisite &ldquo;Lass wi&rsquo; the Bonny Blue Een,&rdquo; is utterly
spoiled by two offences of this kind.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>She&rsquo;ll steal out to meet her loved Donald again,</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>and&mdash;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>The world&rsquo;s false and vanishing scene;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>as Allan Cunningham&rsquo;s still more exquisite &ldquo;Lass of Preston
Mill&rdquo; is by one subjective figure:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Six hills are woolly with my sheep,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six vales
are lowing with my kye.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Burns doubtless committed the same fault again and again; but in
his time it was the fashion; and the older models (for models they are
and will remain for ever) had not been studied and analysed as they
have been since.&nbsp; Burns, indeed, actually spoiled one or two of
his own songs by altering them from their first cast to suit the sentimental
taste of his time.&nbsp; The first version, for instance, of the &ldquo;Banks
and Braes o&rsquo; Bonnie Doon,&rdquo; is far superior to the second
and more popular one, because it dares to go without epithets.&nbsp;
Compare the second stanza of each:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Thou&rsquo;lt break my heart, thou bonnie bird,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That
sings upon the bough;<br />Thou minds me o&rsquo; the happy days<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When
my fause love was true.</p>
<p>* * * *</p>
<p>Thou&rsquo;lt break my heart, thou warbling bird,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That
wantons through the flowery thorn;<br />Thou minds me o&rsquo; departed
joys,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Departed never to return.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>What is said in the latter stanza which has not been said in the
former, and said more dramatically, more as the images would really
present themselves to the speaker&rsquo;s mind?&nbsp; It would be enough
for him that the bird was bonnie, and singing; and his very sorrow would
lead him to analyse and describe as little as possible a thing which
so painfully contrasted with his own feelings; whether the thorn was
flowery or not, would not have mattered to him, unless he had some distinct
association with the thorn-flowers, in which case he would have brought
out the image full and separate, and not merely thrown it in as a make-weight
to &ldquo;thorn&rdquo;&mdash;and this is the great reason why epithets
are, nine times out of ten, mistakes in song and ballad poetry; he never
would have thought of &ldquo;departed&rdquo; before he thought of &ldquo;joys.&rdquo;&nbsp;
A very little consideration of the actual processes of thought in such
a case, will show the truth of our observation, and the instinctive
wisdom of the older song-writers, in putting the epithet as often as
possible after the noun, instead of before it, even at the expense of
grammar.&nbsp; They are bad things at all times in song poetry, these
epithets; and, accordingly, we find that the best German writers, like
Uhland and Heine, get rid of them as much as possible, and succeed thereby,
every word striking and ringing down with full force, no cushion of
an epithet intruding between the reader&rsquo;s brain-anvil and the
poet&rsquo;s hammer to break the blow.&nbsp; In Uhland&rsquo;s &ldquo;Three
Burschen,&rdquo; if we recollect right, there are but two epithets,
and those of the simplest descriptive kind: &ldquo;Thy fair daughter&rdquo;
and a &ldquo;black pall.&rdquo;&nbsp; Were there more, we question whether
the poet would have succeeded, as he has done, in making our flesh creep
as he leads us on from line to line and verse to verse.&nbsp; So Tennyson,
the greatest of our living poets, eschews as much as possible, in his
later writings, these same epithets, except in cases where they are
themselves objective and pictorial&mdash;in short, the very things which
he wants you to look at, as, for instance:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And into silver arrows break<br />The sailing moon
in creek and cove.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>This is fair enough; but, indeed, after laying down our rule, we
must confess that it is very difficult to keep always true to it, in
a language which does not, like the Latin and German, allow us to put
our adjectives very much where we choose.&nbsp; Nevertheless, whether
we can avoid it or not, every time we place before the noun an epithet
which, like &ldquo;departed joys,&rdquo; relates to our consciousness
concerning the object, and not merely to the object itself; or an epithet
which, like &ldquo;flowery thorn,&rdquo; gives us, before we get to
the object itself, those accidents of the object which we only discern
by a second look, by analysis and reflection&mdash;(for the thorn, if
in the flower, would look to us, at the first glance, not &ldquo;flowery,&rdquo;
but &ldquo;white,&rdquo; &ldquo;snowy,&rdquo; or what you will which
expresses colour, and not scientific fact)&mdash;every time, we repeat,
this is done, the poet descends from the objective and dramatic domain
of song, into the subjective and reflective one of elegy.</p>
<p>But the field in which Burns&rsquo;s influence has been, as was to
be expected, most important and most widely felt, is in the poems of
working men.&nbsp; He first proved that it was possible to become a
poet and a cultivated man, without deserting his class, either in station
or in sympathies; nay, that the healthiest and noblest elements of a
lowly-born poet&rsquo;s mind might be, perhaps must be, the very feelings
and thoughts which he brought up with him from below, not those which
he received from above, in the course of his artificial culture.&nbsp;
From the example of Burns, therefore, many a working man, who would
otherwise have &ldquo;died and given no sign,&rdquo; has taken courage,
and spoken out the thought within him, in verse or prose, not always
wisely and well, but in all cases, as it seems to us, in the belief
that he had a sort of divine right to speak and be heard, since Burns
had broken down the artificial ice-wall of centuries, and asserted,
by act as well as song, that &ldquo;a man&rsquo;s a man for a&rsquo;
that.&rdquo;&nbsp; Almost every volume of working men&rsquo;s poetry
which we have read, seems to re-echo poor Nicoll&rsquo;s spirited, though
somewhat over-strained address to the Scottish genius:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>This is the natal day of him<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who, born in
want and poverty,<br />Burst from his fetters and arose,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
freest of the free.</p>
<p>Arose to tell the watching earth<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What lowly
men could feel and do,<br />To show that mighty heaven-like souls<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
cottage hamlets grew.</p>
<p>Burns! thou hast given us a name<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To shield
us from the taunts of scorn:<br />The plant that creeps amid the soil<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
glorious flower has borne.</p>
<p>Before the proudest of the earth<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We stand
with an uplifted brow;<br />Like us, thou wast a toil-worn man,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
we are noble now!</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>The critic, looking calmly on, may indeed question whether this new
fashion of verse-writing among working men has been always conducive
to their own happiness.&nbsp; As for absolute success as poets, that
was not to be expected of one in a hundred, so that we must not be disappointed
if among the volumes of working men&rsquo;s poetry, of which we give
a list at the head of our article, only two should be found, on perusal,
to contain any writing of a very high order, although these volumes
form a very small portion of the verses which have been written, during
the last forty years, by men engaged in the rudest and most monotonous
toil.&nbsp; To every man so writing, the art, doubtless, is an ennobling
one.&nbsp; The habit of expressing thought in verse not only indicates
culture, but is a culture in itself of a very high order.&nbsp; It teaches
the writer to think tersely and definitely; it evokes in him the humanising
sense of grace and melody, not merely by enticing him to study good
models, but by the very act of composition.&nbsp; It gives him a vent
for sorrows, doubts, and aspirations, which might otherwise fret and
canker within, breeding, as they too often do in the utterly dumb English
peasant, self-devouring meditation, dogged melancholy, and fierce fanaticism.&nbsp;
And if the effect of verse-writing had stopped there, all had been well;
but bad models have had their effect, as well as good ones, on the half-tutored
taste of the working men, and engendered in them but too often a fondness
for frothy magniloquence and ferocious raving, neither morally nor &aelig;sthetically
profitable to themselves or their readers.&nbsp; There are excuses for
the fault; the young of all ranks naturally enough mistake noise for
awfulness, and violence for strength; and there is generally but too
much, in the biographies of these working poets, to explain, if not
to excuse, a vein of bitterness, which they certainly did not learn
from their master, Burns.&nbsp; The two poets who have done them most
harm, in teaching the evil trick of cursing and swearing, are Shelley
and the Corn-Law Rhymer; and one can well imagine how seducing two such
models must be, to men struggling to utter their own complaints.&nbsp;
Of Shelley this is not the place to speak.&nbsp; But of the Corn-Law
Rhymer we may say here, that howsoever he may have been indebted to
Burns&rsquo;s example for the notion of writing at all, he has profited
very little by Burns&rsquo;s own poems.&nbsp; Instead of the genial
loving tone of the great Scotchman, we find in Elliott a tone of deliberate
savageness, all the more ugly, because evidently intentional.&nbsp;
He tries to curse; &ldquo;he delights&rdquo;&mdash;may we be forgiven
if we misjudge the man&mdash;&ldquo;in cursing;&rdquo; he makes a science
of it; he defiles, of malice prepense, the loveliest and sweetest thoughts
and scenes (and he can be most sweet) by giving some sudden sickening
revulsion to his reader&rsquo;s feelings; and he does it generally with
a power which makes it at once as painful to the calmer reader as alluring
to those who are struggling with the same temptations as the poet.&nbsp;
Now and then, his trick drags him down into sheer fustian and bombast;
but not always.&nbsp; There is a terrible Dantean vividness of imagination
about him, perhaps unequalled in England, in his generation.&nbsp; His
poems are like his countenance, coarse and ungoverned, yet with an intensity
of eye, a rugged massiveness of feature, which would be grand but for
the seeming deficiency of love and of humour&mdash;love&rsquo;s twin
and inseparable brother.&nbsp; Therefore it is, that although single
passages may be found in his writings, of which Milton himself need
not have been ashamed, his efforts at dramatic poetry are utter failures,
dark, monstrous, unrelieved by any really human vein of feeling or character.&nbsp;
As in feature, so in mind, he has not even the delicate and graceful
organisation which made up in Milton for the want of tenderness, and
so enabled him to write, if not a drama, yet still the sweetest of masques
and idyls.</p>
<p>Rather belonging to the same school than to that of Burns, though
never degrading itself by Elliott&rsquo;s ferocity, is that extraordinary
poem, &ldquo;The Purgatory of Suicides,&rdquo; by Thomas Cooper.&nbsp;
As he is still in the prime of life, and capable of doing more and better
than he yet has done, we will not comment on it as freely as we have
on Elliott, except to regret a similar want of softness and sweetness,
and also of a clearness and logical connection of thought, in which
Elliott seldom fails, except when cursing.&nbsp; The imagination is
hardly as vivid as Elliott&rsquo;s, though the fancy and invention,
the polish of the style, and the indications of profound thought on
all subjects within the poet&rsquo;s reach, are superior in every way
to those of the Corn-Law Rhymer; and when we consider that the man who
wrote it had to gather his huge store of classic and historic anecdote
while earning his living, first as a shoemaker, and then as a Wesleyan
country preacher, we can only praise and excuse, and hope that the day
may come when talents of so high an order will find some healthier channel
for their energies than that in which they now are flowing.</p>
<p>Our readers may wonder at not seeing the Ettrick Shepherd&rsquo;s
poems among the list at the head of the article.&nbsp; It seems to us,
however, that we have done right in omitting them.&nbsp; Doubtless,
he too was awakened into song by the example of Burns; but he seems
to us to owe little to his great predecessor, beyond the general consciousness
that there was a virgin field of poetry in Scotch scenery, manners,
and legends&mdash;a debt which Walter Scott himself probably owed to
the Ayrshire peasant just as much as Hogg did.&nbsp; Indeed, we perhaps
are right in saying, that had Burns not lived, neither Wilson, Galt,
Allan Cunningham, or the crowd of lesser writers who have found material
for their fancy in Scotch peculiarities, would have written, as they
have.&nbsp; The three first names, Wilson&rsquo;s above all, must have
been in any case distinguished; yet it is surely no derogation to some
of the most exquisite rural sketches in &ldquo;Christopher North&rsquo;s
Recreations,&rdquo; to claim them as the intellectual foster-children
of &ldquo;The Cottar&rsquo;s Saturday Night.&rdquo;&nbsp; In this respect,
certainly, the Ettrick Shepherd has a place in Burns&rsquo;s school,
and, in our own opinion, one which has been very much overrated.&nbsp;
But the deeper elements of Burns&rsquo;s mind, those which have especially
endeared him to the working man, reappear very little, or not at all,
in Hogg.&nbsp; He left his class too much below him; became too much
of the mere &aelig;sthetic prodigy, and member of a literary clique;
frittered away his great talents in brilliant talk and insincere Jacobite
songs, and, in fine, worked no deliverance on the earth.&nbsp; It is
sad to have to say this: but we had it forced upon us painfully enough
a few days ago, when re-reading &ldquo;Kilmeny.&rdquo;&nbsp; There may
be beautiful passages in it; but it is not coherent, not natural, not
honest.&nbsp; It is throughout an affectation of the Manich&aelig;an
sentimental-sublime, which God never yet put into the heart of any brawny,
long-headed, practical Borderer, and which he therefore probably put
into his own head, or, as we call it, affected, for the time being;
a method of poetry writing which comes forth out of nothing, and into
nothing must return.</p>
<p>This is unfortunate, perhaps, for the world; for we question whether
a man of talents in anywise to be compared with those of the Ettrick
Shepherd has followed in the footsteps of Burns.&nbsp; Poor Tannahill,
whose sad story is but too well known, perished early, at the age of
thirty-six, leaving behind him a good many pretty love-songs of no great
intrinsic value, if the specimens of them given in Mr. Whitelaw&rsquo;s
collection are to be accepted as the best.&nbsp; Like all Burns&rsquo;s
successors, including even Walter Scott and Hogg, we have but to compare
him with his original to see how altogether unrivalled on his own ground
the Ayrshire farmer was.&nbsp; In one feature only Tannahill&rsquo;s
poems, and those later than him, except where pedantically archaist,
like many of Motherwell&rsquo;s, are an improvement on Burns: namely,
in the more easy and complete interfusion of the two dialects, the Norse
Scotch and the Romanesque English, which Allan Ramsay attempted in vain
to unite; while Burns, though not succeeding by any means perfectly,
welded them together into something of continuity and harmony&mdash;thus
doing for the language of his own country very much what Chaucer did
for that of England&mdash;a happy union, in the opinion of those who,
as we do, look on the vernacular Norse Scotch as no barbaric dialect,
but as an independent tongue, possessing a copiousness, melody, terseness,
and picturesqueness which makes it, both in prose and verse, a far better
vehicle than the popular English for many forms of thought.</p>
<p>Perhaps the young peasant who most expressly stands out as the pupil
and successor of Burns, is Robert Nicoll.&nbsp; He is a lesser poet,
doubtless, than his master, and a lesser man, if the size and number
of his capabilities be looked at; but he is a greater man, in that,
from the beginning to the end of his career, he seems to have kept that
very wholeness of heart and head which poor Burns lost.&nbsp; Nicoll&rsquo;s
story is, mutatis mutandis, that of the Bethunes, and many a noble young
Scotsman more.&nbsp; Parents holding a farm between Perth and Dunkeld,
they and theirs before them for generations inhabitants of the neighbourhood,
&ldquo;decent, honest, God-fearing people.&rdquo;&nbsp; The farm is
lost by reverses, and manfully Robert Nicoll&rsquo;s father becomes
a day-labourer on the fields which he lately rented: and there begins,
for the boy, from his earliest recollections, a life of steady sturdy
drudgery.&nbsp; But they must have been grand old folk, these parents,
and in no wise addicted to wringing their hands over &ldquo;the great
might-have-been.&rdquo;&nbsp; Like true Scots Bible lovers, they do
believe in a God, and in a will of God, underlying, absolute, loving,
and believe that the might-have-been ought not to have been, simply
because it has not been; and so they put their shoulders to the new
collar patiently, cheerfully, hopefully, and teach the boys to do the
same.&nbsp; The mother especially, as so many great men&rsquo;s mothers
do, stands out large and heroic, from the time when, the farm being
gone, she, &ldquo;the ardent book-woman,&rdquo; finds her time too precious
to be spent in reading, and sets little Robert to read to her as she
works&mdash;what a picture!&mdash;to the last sad day, when, wanting
money to come up to Leeds to see her dying darling, she &ldquo;shore
for the siller,&rdquo; rather than borrow it.&nbsp; And her son&rsquo;s
life is like her own&mdash;a most pure, joyous, valiant little epic.&nbsp;
Robert does not even take to work as something beyond himself, uninteresting
and painful, which, however, must be done courageously: he lives in
it, enjoys it as his proper element, one which is no more a burden and
an exertion to him than the rush of the strid is to the trout who plays
and feels in it day and night, unconscious of the amount of muscular
strength which he puts forth in merely keeping his place in the stream.&nbsp;
Whether carrying &ldquo;Kenilworth&rdquo; in his plaid to the woods,
to read while herding, or selling currants and whisky as the Perth storekeeper&rsquo;s
apprentice, or keeping his little circulating library in Dundee, tormenting
his pure heart with the thought of the twenty pounds which his mother
has borrowed wherewith to start him, or editing <i>The Leeds Times</i>,
or lying on his early deathbed, just as life seems to be opening clear
and broad before him, he</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Bates not a jot of heart or hope,</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>but steers right onward, singing over his work, without bluster or
self-gratulation, for very joy at having work to do.&nbsp; There is
a keen practical insight about him, rarely combined, in these days,
with his single-minded determination to do good in his generation.&nbsp;
His eye is single, and his whole body full of light.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>It would indeed (writes the grocer&rsquo;s boy, encouraging his despondent
and somewhat Werterean friend) be hangman&rsquo;s work to write articles
one day to be forgotten to-morrow, if that were all; but you forget
the comfort&mdash;the repayment.&nbsp; If one prejudice is overthrown,
one error rendered untenable; if but one step in advance be the consequence
of your articles and mine&mdash;the consequences of the labour of all
true men&mdash;are we not deeply repaid?</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Or again, in a right noble letter to his noble mother:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>That money of R.&rsquo;s hangs like a millstone about my neck.&nbsp;
If I had paid it, I would never borrow again from mortal man.&nbsp;
But do not mistake me, mother; I am not one of those men who faint and
falter in the great battle of life.&nbsp; God has given me too strong
a heart for that.&nbsp; I look upon earth as a place where every man
is set to struggle and to work, that he may be made humble and pure-hearted,
and fit for that better land for which earth is a preparation&mdash;to
which earth is the gate . . . If men would but consider how little of
real evil there is in all the ills of which they are so much afraid&mdash;poverty
included&mdash;there would be more virtue and happiness, and less world
and Mammon-worship on earth than is.&nbsp; I think, mother, that to
me has been given talent; and if so, that talent was given to make it
useful to man.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>And yet there is a quiet self-respect about him withal:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>In my short course through life (says he in confidence to a friend
at one-and-twenty), I have never feared an enemy, or failed a friend;
and I live in the hope I never shall.&nbsp; For the rest, I have written
my heart in my poems; and rude and unfinished and hasty as they are,
it can be read there.</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p>From seven years of age to this very hour, I have been dependent
only on my own head and hands for everything&mdash;for very bread.&nbsp;
Long years ago&mdash;ay, even in childhood&mdash;adversity made me think,
and feel, and suffer; and would pride allow me, I could tell the world
many a deep tragedy enacted in the heart of a poor, forgotten, uncared-for
boy . . . But I thank God, that though I felt and suffered, the scathing
blast neither blunted my perceptions of natural and moral beauty, nor,
by withering the affections of my heart, made me a selfish man.&nbsp;
Often when I look back I wonder how I bore the burden&mdash;how I did
not end the evil day at once and for ever.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Such, is the man, in his normal state; and as was to be expected,
God&rsquo;s blessing rests on him.&nbsp; Whatever he sets his hand to
succeeds.&nbsp; Within a few weeks of his taking the editorship of <i>The
Leeds Times</i> its circulation begins to rise rapidly, as was to be
expected with an honest man to guide it.&nbsp; For Nicoll&rsquo;s political
creed, though perhaps neither very deep nor wide, lies clear and single
before him, as everything else which he does.&nbsp; He believes naturally
enough in ultra-Radicalism according to the fashions of the Reform Bill
era.&nbsp; That is the right thing; and for that he will work day and
night, body and soul, and if needs be, die.&nbsp; There, in the editor&rsquo;s
den at Leeds, he &ldquo;begins to see the truth of what you told me
about the world&rsquo;s unworthiness; but stop a little.&nbsp; I am
not sad as yet.&nbsp; . . . If I am hindered from feeling the soul of
poetry among woods and fields, I yet trust I am struggling for something
worth prizing&mdash;something of which I am not ashamed, and need not
be.&nbsp; If there be aught on earth worth aspiring to, it is the lot
of him who is enabled to do something for his miserable and suffering
fellow-men; and this you and I will try to do at least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His friend is put to work a ministerial paper, with orders &ldquo;not
to be rash, but to elevate the population gradually;&rdquo; and finding
those orders to imply a considerable leaning towards the By-ends, Lukewarm,
and Facing-both-ways school, kicks over the traces, wisely, in Nicoll&rsquo;s
eyes, and breaks loose.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Keep up your spirits (says honest Nicoll).&nbsp; You are higher at
this moment in my estimation, in your own, and that of every honest
man, than you ever were before.&nbsp; Tait&rsquo;s advice was just such
as I should have expected of him; honest as honesty itself.&nbsp; You
must never again accept a paper but where you can tell the whole truth
without fear or favour. . . . . Tell E. (the broken-loose editor&rsquo;s
lady-love), from me to estimate as she ought the nobility and determination
of the man who has dared to act as you have done.&nbsp; Prudent men
will say that you are hasty: but you have done right, whatever may be
the consequences.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>This is the spirit of Robert Nicoll; the spirit which is the fruit
of early purity and self-restraint, of living &ldquo;on bread-and-cheese
and water,&rdquo; that he may buy books; of walking out to the Inch
of Perth at four o&rsquo;clock on summer mornings, to write and read
in peace before he returns to the currants and the whisky.&nbsp; The
nervous simplicity of the man come out, in the very nervous simplicity
of the prose he writes; and though there be nothing very new or elevated
in it, or indeed in his poems themselves, we call on our readers to
admire a phenomenon so rare, in the &ldquo;upper classes&rdquo; at least,
in these days, and taking a lesson from the peasant&rsquo;s son, rejoice
with us that &ldquo;a man is born into the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For Nicoll, as few do, practises what he preaches.&nbsp; It seems
to him, once on a time, right and necessary that Sir William Molesworth
should be returned for Leeds; and Nicoll having so determined, &ldquo;throws
himself, body and soul, into the contest, with such ardour, that his
wife afterwards said (and we can well believe it) that if Sir William
had failed, Robert would have died on the instant!&rdquo;&mdash;why
not?&nbsp; Having once made up his mind that that was the just and right
thing, the thing which was absolutely good for Leeds, and the human
beings who lived in it, was it not a thing to die for, even if it had
been but the election of a new beadle?&nbsp; The advanced sentry is
set to guard some obscure worthless dike-end&mdash;obscure and worthless
in itself, but to him a centre of infinite duty.&nbsp; True, the fate
of the camp does not depend on its being taken; if the enemy round it,
there are plenty behind to blow them out again.&nbsp; But that is no
reason whatsoever why he, before any odds, should throw his musket over
his shoulder, and retreat gracefully to the lines.&nbsp; He was set
there to stand by that, whether dike-end or representation of Leeds;
that is the right thing for him; and for that right he will fight, and
if he be killed, die.&nbsp; So have all brave men felt, and so have
all brave deeds been done, since man walked the earth.&nbsp; It is because
that spirit, the spirit of faith, has died out among us, that so few
brave deeds are done now, except on battle-fields and in hovels, whereof
none but God and the angels know.</p>
<p>So the man prospers.&nbsp; Several years of honourable and self-restraining
love bring him a wife, beautiful, loving, worshipping his talents; a
help meet for him, such as God will send at times to those whom he loves.&nbsp;
Kind men meet and love and help him&mdash;&ldquo;The Johnstones, Mr.
Tait, William and Mary Howitt;&rdquo; Sir William Molesworth, hearing
of his last illness, sends him unsolicited fifty pounds, which, as we
understand it, Nicoll accepts without foolish bluster about independence.&nbsp;
Why not?&mdash;man should help man, and be helped by him.&nbsp; Would
he not have done as much for Sir William?&nbsp; Nothing to us proves
Nicoll&rsquo;s heart-wholeness more than the way in which he talks of
his benefactors, in a tone of simple gratitude and affection, without
fawning and without vapouring.&nbsp; The man has too much self-respect
to consider himself lowered by accepting a favour.</p>
<p>But he must go after all.&nbsp; The editor&rsquo;s den at Leeds is
not the place for lungs bred on Perthshire breezes; and work rises before
him, huger and heavier as he goes on, till he drops under the ever-increasing
load.&nbsp; He will not believe it at first.&nbsp; In sweet childlike
playful letters, he tells his mother that it is nothing.&nbsp; It has
done him good&mdash;&ldquo;opened the grave before his eyes, and taught
him to think of death.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He trusts that he has not
borne this, and suffered, and thought in vain.&rdquo;&nbsp; This too,
he hopes, is to be a fresh lesson-page of experience for his work.&nbsp;
Alas! a few months more of bitter suffering, and of generous kindness
and love from all around him&mdash;and it is over with him at the age
of twenty-three.&nbsp; Shall we regret him?&mdash;shall we not rather
believe that God knew best; and considering the unhealthy moral atmosphere
of the second-class press, and the strange confused ways into which
old ultra-Radicalism, finding itself too narrow for the new problems
of the day, has stumbled and floundered during the last fifteen years,
believe that he might have been a worse man had he been a longer-lived
one, and thank heaven that &ldquo;the righteous is taken away from the
evil to come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As it is, he ends as he began.&nbsp; The first poem in his book is
&ldquo;The Ha&rsquo; Bible;&rdquo; and the last, written a few days
before his death, is still the death-song of a man&mdash;without fear,
without repining, without boasting, blessing and loving the earth which
he leaves, yet with a clear joyful eye upwards and outwards and homewards.&nbsp;
And so ends his little epic, as we called it.&nbsp; May Scotland see
many such another!</p>
<p>The actual poetic value of his verses is not first-rate by any means.&nbsp;
He is far inferior to Burns in range of subject, as he is in humour
and pathos.&nbsp; Indeed, there is very little of these latter qualities
in him anywhere&mdash;rather playfulness, flashes of childlike fun,
as in &ldquo;The Provost,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bonnie Bessie Lee.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But he has attained a mastery over English, a simplicity and quiet which
Burns never did; and also, we need not say, a moral purity.&nbsp; His
&ldquo;Poems illustrative of the Scotch peasantry&rdquo; are charming
throughout&mdash;alive and bright with touches of real humanity, and
sympathy with characters apparently antipodal to his own.</p>
<p>His more earnest poems are somewhat tainted with that cardinal fault
of his school, of which he steered so clear in prose&mdash;fine words;
yet he never, like the Corn-Law Rhymer, falls a cursing.&nbsp; He is
evidently not a good hater even of &ldquo;priests and kings, and aristocrats,
and superstition;&rdquo; or perhaps he worked all that froth safely
over and off in debating-club speeches and leading articles, and left
us, in these poems, the genuine metheglin of his inner heart, sweet,
clear, and strong; for there is no form of lovable or right thing which
this man has come across, which he does not seem to have appreciated.&nbsp;
Besides pure love and the beauties of nature&mdash;those on which every
man of poetic power, and a great many of none, as a matter of course,
have a word to say&mdash;he can feel for and with the drunken beggar,
and the warriors of the ruined manor-house, and the monks of the abbey,
and the old mailed Normans with their &ldquo;priest with cross and counted
beads in the little Saxon chapel&rdquo;&mdash;things which a Radical
editor might have been excused for passing by with a sneer.</p>
<p>His verses to his wife are a delicious little glimpse of Eden; and
his &ldquo;People&rsquo;s Anthem&rdquo; rises into somewhat of true
grandeur by virtue of simplicity:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Lord, from Thy blessed throne,<br />Sorrow look down upon!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God
save the Poor!<br />Teach them true liberty&mdash;<br />Make them from
tyrants free&mdash;<br />Let their homes happy be!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God
save the Poor!</p>
<p>The arms of wicked men<br />Do Thou with might restrain&mdash;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God
save the Poor!<br />Raise Thou their lowliness&mdash;<br />Succour Thou
their distress&mdash;<br />Thou whom the meanest bless!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God
save the Poor!</p>
<p>Give them stanch honesty&mdash;<br />Let their pride manly be&mdash;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God
save the Poor!<br />Help them to hold the right;<br />Give them both
truth and might,<br />Lord of all LIFE and LIGHT!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God
save the Poor!</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>And so we leave Robert Nicoll, with the parting remark, that if the
&ldquo;Poems illustrative of the feelings of the intelligent and religious
among the working-classes of Scotland&rdquo; be fair samples of that
which they profess to be, Scotland may thank God, that in spite of temporary
manufacturing rot-heaps, she is still whole at heart; and that the influence
of her great peasant poet, though it may seem at first likely to be
adverse to Christianity, has helped, as we have already hinted, to purify
and not to taint; to destroy the fungus, but not to touch the heart,
of the grand old Covenant-kirk life-tree.</p>
<p>Still sweeter, and, alas! still sadder, is the story of the two Bethunes.&nbsp;
If Nicoll&rsquo;s life, as we have said, be a solitary melody, and short
though triumphant strain of work-music, theirs is a harmony and true
concert of fellow-joys, fellow-sorrows, fellow-drudgery, fellow-authorship,
mutual throughout, lovely in their joint-life, and in their deaths not
far divided.&nbsp; Alexander survives his brother John only long enough
to write his &ldquo;Memoirs,&rdquo; and then follows; and we have his
story given us by Mr. M&rsquo;Combie, in a simple unassuming little
volume&mdash;not to be read without many thoughts, perhaps not rightly
without tears.&nbsp; Mr. M&rsquo;Combie has been wise enough not to
attempt panegyric.&nbsp; He is all but prolix in details, filling up
some half of his volume with letters of preternatural length from Alexander
to his publishers and critics, and from the said publishers and critics
to Alexander, altogether of an unromantic and business-like cast, but
entirely successful in doing that which a book should do&mdash;namely,
in showing the world that here was a man of like passions with ourselves,
who bore from boyhood to the grave hunger, cold, wet, rags, brutalising
and health-destroying toil, and all the storms of the world, the flesh,
and the devil, and conquered them every one.</p>
<p>Alexander is set at fourteen to throw earth out of a ditch so deep,
that it requires the full strength of a grown man, and loses flesh and
health under the exertion; he is twice blown up with his own blast in
quarrying, and left for dead, recovers slowly, maimed and scarred, with
the loss of an eye.&nbsp; John, when not thirteen, is set to stone-breaking
on the roads during intense cold, and has to keep himself from being
frostbitten and heart-broken by monkey gambols; takes to the weaving
trade, and having helped his family by the most desperate economy to
save ten pounds wherewith to buy looms, begins to work them, with his
brother as an apprentice, and finds the whole outlay rendered useless
the very same year by the failures of 1825-26.&nbsp; So the two return
to day-labour at fourteenpence a-day.&nbsp; John, in a struggle to do
task-work honestly, over-exerts himself, and ruins his digestion for
life.&nbsp; Next year he is set in November to clean out a watercourse
knee-deep in water; then to take marl from a pit; and then to drain
standing water off a swamp during an intense December frost; and finds
himself laid down with a three months&rsquo; cough, and all but sleepless
illness, laying the foundation of the consumption which destroyed him.&nbsp;
But the two brothers will not give in.&nbsp; Poetry they will write;
and they write it to the best of their powers, on scraps of paper, after
the drudgery of the day, in a cabin pervious to every shower, teaching
themselves the right spelling of the words from some &ldquo;Christian
Remembrancer&rdquo; or other&mdash;apparently not our meek and unbiassed
contemporary of that name; and all this without neglecting their work
a day or even an hour, when the weather permitted&mdash;the &ldquo;only
thing which tempted them to fret,&rdquo; being&mdash;hear it, readers,
and perpend!&mdash;&ldquo;the being kept at home by rain and snow.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then an additional malady (apparently some calculous one) comes on John,
and stops by him for the six remaining years of his life.&nbsp; Yet
between 1826 and 1832, John had saved fourteen pounds out of his miserable
earnings, to be expended to the last farthing on his brother&rsquo;s
recovery from the second quarry accident.&nbsp; Surely the devil is
trying hard to spoil these men.&nbsp; But no.&nbsp; They are made perfect
by sufferings.&nbsp; In the house with one long narrow room, and a small
vacant space at the end of it, lighted by a single pane of glass, they
write and write untiring, during the long summer evenings, poetry, &ldquo;Tales
of the Scottish Peasant Life,&rdquo; which at last bring them in somewhat;
and a work on practical economy, which is bepraised and corrected by
kind critics in Edinburgh, and at last published&mdash;without a sale.&nbsp;
Perhaps one cause of its failure might be found in those very corrections.&nbsp;
There were too many violent political allusions in it, complains their
good Mentor of Edinburgh; and persuades them, seemingly the most meek
and teachable of heroes, to omit them; though Alexander, while submitting,
pleads fairly enough for retaining them, in a passage which we will
give, as a specimen of the sort of English possible to be acquired by
a Scotch day-labourer, self-educated, all but the rudiments of reading
and writing, and a few lectures on popular poetry from &ldquo;a young
student of Aberdeen,&rdquo; now the Rev. Mr. Adamson, who must look
back on the friendship which he bore these two young men as one of the

<p>Talk to the many of religion, and they will put on a long face, confess
that it is a thing of the greatest importance to all&mdash;and go away
and forget the whole.&nbsp; Talk to them of education; they will readily
acknowledge that it&rsquo;s &ldquo;a braw thing to be weel learned,&rdquo;
and begin a lamentation, which is only shorter than the lamentations
of Jeremiah because they cannot make it as long, on the ignorance of
the age in which they live; but they neither stir hand nor foot in the
matter.&nbsp; But speak to them of politics, and their excited countenances
and kindling eye show in a moment how deeply they are interested.&nbsp;
Politics are therefore an important feature, and an almost indispensable
element in such a work as mine.&nbsp; Had it consisted solely of exhortations
to industry and rules of economy, it would have been dismissed with
an &ldquo;Ou ay, it&rsquo;s braw for him to crack that way: but if he
were whaur we are, &rsquo;deed he wad just hae to do as we do.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But by mixing up the science with politics, and giving it an occasional
political impetus, a different result may be reasonably expected.&nbsp;
In these days no man can be considered a patriot or friend of the poor,
who is not also a politician.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>It is amusing, by-the-bye, to see how the world changes its codes
of respectability, and how, what is anathema in one generation, becomes
trite orthodoxy in the next.&nbsp; The political sins in the work were,
that &ldquo;my brother had attacked the corn-laws with some severity;
and I have attempted to level a battery against that sort of servile
homage which the poor pay to the rich!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is no use pursuing the story much farther.&nbsp; They again
save a little money, and need it; for the estate on which they have
lived from childhood changing hands, they are, with their aged father,
expelled from the dear old dog-kennel to find house-room where they
can.&nbsp; Why not?&mdash;&ldquo;it was not in the bond.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The house did not belong to them; nothing of it, at least, which could
be specified in any known lease.&nbsp; True, there may have been associations:
but what associations can men be expected to cultivate on fourteenpence
a-day?&nbsp; So they must forth, with their two aged parents, and build
with their own hands a new house elsewhere, having saved some thirty
pounds from the sale of their writings.&nbsp; The house, as we understand,
stands to this day&mdash;hereafter to become a sort of artisan&rsquo;s
caaba and pilgrim&rsquo;s station, only second to Burns&rsquo;s grave.&nbsp;
That, at least, it will become, whenever the meaning of the words &ldquo;worth&rdquo;
and &ldquo;worship&rdquo; shall become rightly understood among us.</p>
<p>For what are these men, if they are not heroes and saints?&nbsp;
Not of the Popish sort, abject and effeminate, but of the true, human,
evangelic sort, masculine and grand&mdash;like the figures in Raffaelle&rsquo;s
Cartoons compared with those of Fra Bartolomeo.&nbsp; Not from superstition,
not from selfish prudence, but from devotion to their aged parents,
and the righteous dread of dependence, they die voluntary celibates,
although their writings show that they, too, could have loved as nobly
as they did all other things.&nbsp; The extreme of endurance, self-restraint,
of &ldquo;conquest of the flesh,&rdquo; outward as well as inward, is
the life-long lot of these men; and they go through it.&nbsp; They have
their share of injustice, tyranny, disappointment; one by one each bright
boy&rsquo;s dream of success and renown is scourged out of their minds,
and sternly and lovingly their Father in heaven teaches them the lesson
of all lessons.&nbsp; By what hours of misery and blank despair that
faith was purchased, we can only guess; the simple strong men give us
the result, but never dream of sitting down and analysing the process
for the world&rsquo;s amusement or their own glorification.&nbsp; We
question, indeed, whether they could have told us; whether the mere
fact of a man&rsquo;s being able to dissect himself, in public or in
private, is not proof-patent that he is no man, but only a shell of
a man, with works inside, which can of course be exhibited and taken
to pieces&mdash;a rather more difficult matter with flesh and blood.&nbsp;
If we believe that God is educating, the when, the where, and the how
are not only unimportant, but, considering who is the teacher, unfathomable
to us, and it is enough to be able to believe with John Bethune that
the Lord of all things is influencing us through all things; whether
sacraments, or sabbaths, or sun-gleams, or showers&mdash;all things
are ours, for all are His, and we are His, and He is ours&mdash;and
for the rest, to say with the same John Bethune:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Oh God of glory! thou hast treasured up<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
me my little portion of distress;<br />But with each draught&mdash;in
every bitter cup<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy hand hath mixed, to make
its soreness less,<br />Some cordial drop, for which thy name I bless,<br />And
offer up my mite of thankfulness.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou hast chastised
my frame with dire disease,<br />Long, obdurate, and painful; and thy
hand<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hath wrung cold sweat-drops from my brow;
for these<br />I thank thee too.&nbsp; Though pangs at thy command<br />Have
compassed me about, still, with the blow,<br />Patience sustained my
soul amid its woe.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Of the actual literary merit of these men&rsquo;s writings there
is less to be said.&nbsp; However extraordinary, considering the circumstances
under which they were written, may be the polish and melody of John&rsquo;s
verse, or the genuine spiritual health, deep death-and-devil-defying
earnestness, and shrewd practical wisdom, which shines through all that
either brother writes, they do not possess any of that fertile originality,
which alone would have enabled them, as it did Burns, to compete with
the literary savants, who, though for the most part of inferior genius,
have the help of information and appliances, from which they were shut
out.&nbsp; Judging them, as the true critic, like the true moralist,
is bound to do, &ldquo;according to what they had, not according to
what they had not,&rdquo; they are men who, with average advantages,
might have been famous in their day.&nbsp; God thought it better for
them to &ldquo;hide them in his tabernacle from the strife of tongues;&rdquo;
and&mdash;seldom believed truism&mdash;He knows best.&nbsp; Alexander
shall not, according to his early dreams, &ldquo;earn nine hundred pounds
by writing a book, like Burns,&rdquo; even though his ideal method of
spending be to buy all the boys in the parish &ldquo;new shoes with
iron tackets and heels,&rdquo; and send them home with shillings for
their mothers, and feed their fathers on wheat bread and milk, with
tea and bannocks for Sabbath-days, and build a house for the poor old
toil-stiffened man whom he once saw draining the hill field, &ldquo;with
a yard full of gooseberries, and an apple-tree!&rdquo;&mdash;not that,
nor even, as the world judges, better than that, shall he be allowed
to do.&nbsp; The poor, for whom he writes his &ldquo;Practical Economy,&rdquo;
shall not even care to read it; and he shall go down to the grave a
failure and a lost thing in the eyes of men: but not in the eyes of
grand God-fearing old Alison Christie, his mother, as he brings her,
scrap by scrap, the proofs of their dead idol&rsquo;s poems, which she
has prayed to be spared just to see once in print, and, when the last
half-sheet is read, loses her sight for ever&mdash;not in her eyes,
nor in those of God who saw him, in the cold winter mornings, wearing
John&rsquo;s clothes, to warm them for the dying man before he got up.</p>
<p>His grief at his brother&rsquo;s death is inconsolable.&nbsp; He
feels for the first time in his life, what a lot is his&mdash;for he
feels for the first time that&mdash;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Parent and friend and brother gone,<br />I stand upon the earth alone.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Four years he lingers; friends begin to arise from one quarter and
another, but he, not altogether wisely or well, refuses all pecuniary
help.&nbsp; At last Mr. Hugh Miller recommends him to be editor of a
projected &ldquo;Non-Intrusion&rdquo; paper in Dumfries, with a salary,
to him boundless, of 100<i>l</i>. a-year.&nbsp; Too late!&nbsp; The
iron has entered too deeply into his soul; in a few weeks more he is
lying in his brother&rsquo;s grave&mdash;&ldquo;Lovely and pleasant
in their lives, and in their deaths not divided.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;William Thom of Inverury&rdquo; is a poet altogether of the
same school.&nbsp; His &ldquo;Rhymes and Recollections of a Handloom
Weaver&rdquo; are superior to those of either Nicoll or the Bethunes,
the little love-songs in the volume reminding us of Burns&rsquo;s best
manner, and the two languages in which he writes being better amalgamated,
as it seems to us, than in any Scotch songwriter.&nbsp; Moreover, there
is a terseness, strength, and grace about some of these little songs,
which would put to shame many a volume of vague and windy verse, which
the press sees yearly sent forth by men, who, instead of working at
the loom, have been pampered from their childhood with all the means
and appliances of good taste and classic cultivation.&nbsp; We have
room only for one specimen of his verse, not the most highly finished,
but of a beauty which can speak for itself.</p>

<p>DREAMINGS OF THE BEREAVED.</p>
<p>The morning breaks bonny o&rsquo;er mountain and stream,<br />An&rsquo;
troubles the hallowed breath of my dream.<br />The gowd light of morning
is sweet to the e&rsquo;e,<br />But ghost-gathering midnight, thou&rsquo;rt
dearer to me.<br />The dull common world then sinks from my sight,<br />And
fairer creations arise to the night;<br />When drowsy oppression has
sleep-sealed my e&rsquo;e,<br />Then bright are the visions awakened
to me!</p>
<p>Oh, come, spirit-mother! discourse of the hours<br />My young bosom
beat all its beating to yours,<br />When heart-woven wishes in soft
counsel fell<br />On ears&mdash;how unheedful, proved sorrow might tell!<br />That
deathless affection nae sorrow could break;<br />When all else forsook
me, ye would na forsake;<br />Then come, oh my mother! come often to

<p>An&rsquo; then, shrouded loveliness! soul-winning Jean,<br />How
cold was thy hand on my bosom yestreen!<br />&rsquo;Twas kind&mdash;for
the love that your e&rsquo;e kindled there<br />Will burn, ay an&rsquo;

<p>Though dark be our dwellin&rsquo;, our happin&rsquo; tho&rsquo; bare,<br />And
night closes round us in cauldness and care,<br />Affection will warm
us&mdash;and bright are the beams<br />That halo our hame in yon dear
land o&rsquo; dreams:<br />Then weel may I welcome the night&rsquo;s
deathly reign,<br />Wi&rsquo; souls of the dearest I mingle me then;<br />The
gowd light of morning is lightless to me,<br />But, oh for the night
with its ghost revelrie!</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>But even more interesting than the poems themselves, is the autobiographical
account prefixed, with its vivid sketches of factory life in Aberdeen,
of the old regime of 1770; when &ldquo;four days did the weaver&rsquo;s
work&mdash;Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, were of course jubilee.&nbsp; Lawn
frills gorged (?) freely from under the wrists of his fine blue gilt-buttoned
coat.&nbsp; He dusted his head with white flour on Sunday, smirked and
wore a cane; walked in clean slippers on Monday; Tuesday heard him talk
war bravado, quote Volney, and get drunk: weaving commenced gradually
on Wednesday.&nbsp; Then were little children pirn-fillers, and such
were taught to steal warily past the gate-keeper, concealing the bottle.&nbsp;
These wee smugglers had a drop for their services, over and above their
chances of profiting by the elegant and edifying discussions uttered
in their hearing.&nbsp; Infidelity was then getting fashionable.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But by the time Thom enters on his seventeen years&rsquo; weaving, in
1814, the Nemesis has come.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wages are six shillings a-week
where they had been forty; but the weaver of forty shillings, with money
instead of wit, had bequeathed his vices to the weaver of six shillings,
with wit instead of money.&rdquo;&nbsp; The introduction of machinery
works evil rather than good, on account of the reckless way in which
it is used, and the reckless material which it uses.&nbsp; &ldquo;Vacancies
in the factory, daily made, were daily filled by male and female workers;
often queer enough people, and from all parts&mdash;none too coarse
for using.&nbsp; The pickpocket, trained to the loom six months in Bridewell,
came forth a journeyman weaver; and his precious experiences were infused
into the common moral puddle, and in due time did their work.&rdquo;&nbsp;
No wonder that &ldquo;the distinctive character of all sunk away.&nbsp;
Man became less manly&mdash;woman unlovely and rude.&rdquo;&nbsp; No
wonder that the factory, like too many more, though a thriving concern
to its owners, becomes &ldquo;a prime nursery of vice and sorrow.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Virtue perished utterly within its walls, and was dreamed of
no more; or, if remembered at all, only in a deep and woful sense of
self-debasement&mdash;a struggling to forget, where it was hopeless
to obtain.&rdquo;&nbsp; But to us, almost the most interesting passage
in his book, and certainly the one which bears most directly on the
general purpose of this article, is one in which he speaks of the effects
of song on himself and his fellow factory-workers.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Moore was doing all he could for love-sick boys and girls, yet they
had never enough!&nbsp; Nearer and dearer to hearts like ours was the
Ettrick Shepherd, then in his full tide of song and story; but nearer
and dearer still than he, or any living songster, was our ill-fated
fellow-craftsman Tannahill.&nbsp; Poor weaver chiel! what we owe to
you!&mdash;your &ldquo;Braes of Balquidder,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Yon Burnside,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Gloomy Winter,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Minstrel&rsquo;s&rdquo;
wailing ditty, and the noble &ldquo;Gleneiffer.&rdquo;&nbsp; Oh! how
they did ring above the rattle of a thousand shuttles!&nbsp; Let me
again proclaim the debt which we owe to these song spirits, as they
walked in melody from loom to loom, ministering to the low-hearted;
and when the breast was filled with everything but hope and happiness,
let only break out the healthy and vigorous chorus, &ldquo;A man&rsquo;s
a man for a&rsquo; that,&rdquo; and the fagged weaver brightens up .
. . Who dare measure the restraining influences of these very songs?&nbsp;
To us they were all instead of sermons.&nbsp; Had one of us been bold
enough to enter a church, he must have been ejected for the sake of
decency.&nbsp; His forlorn and curiously patched habiliments would have
contested the point of attraction with the ordinary eloquence of that
period.&nbsp; Church bells rang not for us.&nbsp; Poets were indeed
our priests: but for those, the last relic of moral existence would
have passed away.&nbsp; Song was the dewdrop which gathered during the
long dark night of despondency, and was sure to glitter in the very
first blink of the sun.&nbsp; You might have seen &ldquo;Auld Robin
Gray&rdquo; wet the eyes that could be tearless amid cold and hunger,
and weariness and pain.&nbsp; Surely, surely, then there was to that
heart one passage left.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Making all allowance for natural and pardonable high-colouring, we
recommend this most weighty and significant passage to the attention
of all readers, and draw an argumentum &agrave; fortiori, from the high
estimation in which Thom holds those very songs of Tannahill&rsquo;s,
of which we just now spoke somewhat depreciatingly, for the extreme
importance which we attach to popular poetry, as an agent of incalculable
power in moulding the minds of nations.</p>
<p>The popular poetry of Germany has held that great nation together,
united and heart-whole for centuries, in spite of every disadvantage
of internal division, and the bad influence of foreign taste; and the
greatest of their poets have not thought it beneath them to add their
contributions, and their very best, to the common treasure, meant not
only for the luxurious and learned, but for the workman and the child
at school.&nbsp; In Great Britain, on the contrary, the people have
been left to form their own tastes, and choose their own modes of utterance,
with great results, both for good and evil; and there has sprung up
before the new impulse which Burns gave to popular poetry, a considerable
literature&mdash;considerable not only from, its truth and real artistic
merit, but far more so from its being addressed principally to the working
classes.&nbsp; Even more important is this people&rsquo;s literature
question, in our eyes, than the more palpable factors of the education
question, about which we now hear such ado.&nbsp; It does seem to us,
that to take every possible precaution about the spiritual truth which
children are taught in school, and then leave to chance the more impressive
and abiding teaching which popular literature, songs especially, give
them out of doors, is as great a <i>niaiserie</i> as that of the Tractarians
who insisted on getting into the pulpit in their surplices, as a sign
that the clergy only had the right of preaching to the people, while
they forgot that, by means of a free press (of the licence of which
they, too, were not slack to avail themselves), every penny-a-liner
was preaching to the people daily, and would do so, maugre their surplices,
to the end of time.&nbsp; The man who makes the people&rsquo;s songs
is a true popular preacher.&nbsp; Whatsoever, true or false, he sends
forth, will not be carried home, as a sermon often is, merely in heads,
to be forgotten before the week is out: it will ring in the ears, and
cling round the imagination, and follow the pupil to the workshop, and
the tavern, and the fireside; even to the deathbed, such power is in
the magic of rhyme.&nbsp; The emigrant, deep in Australian forests,
may take down Chalmers&rsquo;s sermons on Sabbath evenings from the
scanty shelf: but the songs of Burns have been haunting his lips, and
cheering his heart, and moulding him, unconsciously to himself, in clearing
and in pasture all the weary week.&nbsp; True, if he be what a Scotchman
should be, more than one old Hebrew psalm has brought its message to
him during these week-days; but there are feelings of his nature on
which those psalms, not from defect, but from their very purpose, do
not touch: how is he to express them, but in the songs which echo them?&nbsp;
These will keep alive, and intensify in him, and in the children who
learn them from his lips, all which is like themselves.&nbsp; Is it,
we ask again, to be left to chance what sort of songs these shall be?</p>
<p>As for poetry written for the working classes by the upper, such
attempts at it as we yet have seen, may be considered nil.&nbsp; The
upper must learn to know more of the lower, and to make the lower know
more of them&mdash;a frankness of which we honestly believe they will
never have to repent.&nbsp; Moreover, they must read Burns a little
more, and cavaliers and Jacobites a little less.&nbsp; As it is, their
efforts have been as yet exactly in that direction which would most
safely secure the blessings of undisturbed obscurity.&nbsp; Whether
&ldquo;secular&rdquo; or &ldquo;spiritual,&rdquo; they have thought
proper to adopt a certain Tommy-good-child tone, which, whether to Glasgow
artisans or Dorsetshire labourers, or indeed for any human being who
is &ldquo;grinding among the iron facts of life,&rdquo; is, to say the
least, nauseous; and the only use of their poematicula has been to demonstrate
practically the existence of a great and fearful gulf between those
who have, and those who have not, in thought as well as in purse, which
must be, in the former article at least, bridged over as soon as possible,
if we are to remain one people much longer.&nbsp; The attempts at verse
for children are somewhat more successful&mdash;a certain little &ldquo;Moral
Songs&rdquo; especially, said to emanate from the Tractarian School,
yet full of a health, spirit, and wild sweetness, which makes its authoress,
in our eyes, &ldquo;wiser than her teachers.&rdquo;&nbsp; But this is
our way.&nbsp; We are too apt to be afraid of the men, and take to the
children as our <i>pis-aller</i>, covering our despair of dealing with
the majority, the adult population, in a pompous display of machinery
for influencing that very small fraction, the children.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,
but the destinies of the empire depend on the rising generation!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Who has told us so?&mdash;how do we know that they do not depend on
the risen generation?&nbsp; Who are likely to do more work during our
lifetime, for good and evil,&mdash;those who are now between fifteen
and five-and-forty, or those who are between five and fifteen?&nbsp;
Yet for those former, the many, and the working, and the powerful, all
we seem to be inclined to do is to parody Scripture, and say: &ldquo;He
that is unjust, let him be unjust still; and he that is filthy, let
him be filthy still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not that we ask any one to sit down, and, out of mere benevolence,
to write songs for the people.&nbsp; Wooden out of a wooden birthplace,
would such go forth, to feed fires, not spirits.&nbsp; But if any man
shall read these pages, to whom God has given a truly poetic temperament,
a gallant heart, a melodious ear, a quick and sympathetic eye for all
forms of human joy, and sorrow, and humour, and grandeur; an insight
which can discern the outlines of the butterfly, when clothed in the
roughest and most rugged chrysalis-hide; if the teachers of his heart
and purposes, and not merely of his taste and sentiments, have been
the great songs of his own and of every land and age; if he can see
in the divine poetry of David and Solomon, of Isaiah and Jeremiah, and,
above all, in the parables of Him who spake as never man spake, the
models and elemental laws of a people&rsquo;s poetry, alike according
to the will of God and the heart of man; if he can welcome gallantly
and hopefully the future, and yet know that it must be, unless it would
be a monster and a machine, the loving and obedient child of the past;
if he can speak of the subjects which alone will interest the many,
on love, marriage, the sorrows of the poor, their hopes, political and
social, their wrongs, as well as their sins and duties; and that with
a fervour and passion akin to the spirit of Burns and Elliott, yet with
more calmness, more purity, more wisdom, and therefore with more hope,
as one who stands upon a vantage-ground of education and culture, sympathising
none the less with those who struggle behind him in the valley of the
shadow of death, yet seeing from the mountain peaks the coming dawn,
invisible as yet to them: then let that man think it no fall, but rather
a noble rise, to leave awhile the barren glacier ranges of pure art,
for the fertile gardens of practical and popular song, and write for
the many, and with the many, in words such as they can understand; remembering
that that which is simplest is always deepest; that the many contain
in themselves the few; and that when he speaks to the wanderer and the
drudge, he speaks to the elemental and primeval man, and in him speaks
to all who have risen out of him.&nbsp; Let him try, undiscouraged by
inevitable failures; and if at last he succeeds in giving vent to one
song which will cheer hard-worn hearts at the loom and the forge, or
wake one pauper&rsquo;s heart with the hope that his children are destined
not to die as he died, or recall, amid Canadian forests or Australian
sheep-walks, one thrill of love for the old country, her liberties,
and her laws, and her religion, to the settler&rsquo;s heart&mdash;let
that man know that he has earned a higher place among the spirits of
the wise and good, by doing, in spite of the unpleasantness of self-denial,
the duty which lay nearest him, than if he had out-rivalled Goethe on
his own classic ground, and made all the cultivated and the comfortable
of the earth desert, for the exquisite creations of his fancy, Faust,
and Tasso, and Iphigenie.</p>

<h2>THE POETRY OF SACRED AND LEGENDARY ART <a name="citation187"></a><a href="#footnote187">{187}</a></h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Much attention has been excited this year by the alleged fulfilment
of a prophecy that the Papal power was to receive its death-blow&mdash;in
temporal matters, at least&mdash;during the past year 1848.&nbsp; For
ourselves, we have no more faith in Mr. Fleming, the obsolete author,
who has so suddenly revived in the public esteem, than we have in many
other interpreters of prophecy.&nbsp; Their shallow and bigoted views
of past history are enough to damp our faith in their discernment of
the future.&nbsp; It does seem that people ought to understand what
has been, before they predict what will be.&nbsp; History is &ldquo;the
track of God&rsquo;s footsteps through time;&rdquo; it is in His dealings
with our forefathers that we may expect to find the laws by which He
will deal with us.&nbsp; Not that Mr. Fleming&rsquo;s conjecture must
be false; among a thousand guesses there ought surely to be one right
one.&nbsp; And it is almost impossible for earnest men to bend their
whole minds, however clumsily, to one branch of study without arriving
at some truth or other.&nbsp; The interpreters of prophecy therefore,
like all other interpreters, have our best wishes, though not our sanguine
hopes.&nbsp; But, in the meantime, there are surely signs of the approaching
ruin of Popery, more certain than any speculations on the mystic numbers
of the Revelation.&nbsp; We should point to recent books&mdash;not to
books which merely expose Rome, that has been done long ago, usque ad
nauseam&mdash;but to books which do her justice: to Mr. Maitland&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Dark Ages;&rdquo; Lord Lindsay&rsquo;s &ldquo;Christian Art;&rdquo;
and last, but not least, to the very charming work of Mrs. Jameson,
whose title heads this review.&nbsp; In them, and in a host of similar
works in Germany, which Dr. Wiseman&rsquo;s party hail as signs of coming
triumph, we fancy we see the death-warrant of Romanism; because they
prove that Rome has nearly done her work&mdash;that the Protestants
are learning the lesson for the sake of which Providence has so long
borne with that monstrous system.&nbsp; When Popery has no more truth
to teach us, but not till then, will it vanish away into its native
night.</p>
<p>We entreat Protestant readers not to be alarmed at us.&nbsp; We have
not the slightest tendency toward the stimulants of Popery, either in
their Roman unmixed state, or in their diluted Oxford form.&nbsp; We
are, with all humility, more Protestant than Protestantism itself; our
fastidious nostril, more sensitive of Jesuits than even those of the
author of &ldquo;Hawkstone,&rdquo; has led us at moments to fancy that
we scent indulgences in Conduit-street Chapel, and discern inquisitors
in Exeter Hall itself.&nbsp; Seriously, none believe more firmly than
ourselves that the cause of Protestantism is the cause of liberty, of
civilisation, of truth; the cause of man and God.&nbsp; And because
we think Mrs. Jameson&rsquo;s book especially Protestant, both in manner
and intention, and likely to do service to the good cause, we are setting
to work herein to praise and recommend it.&nbsp; For the time, we think,
for calling Popery ill names is past; though to abstain is certainly
sometimes a sore restraint for English spirits, as Mrs. Jameson herself,
we suspect, has found; but Romanism has been exposed and refuted triumphantly,
every month for centuries, and yet the Romish nations are not converted;
and too many English families of late have found, by sad experience,
that such arguments as are in vogue are powerless to dissuade the young
from rushing headlong into the very superstitions which they have been
taught from their childhood to deride.&nbsp; The truth is, Protestantism
may well cry: &ldquo;Save me from my friends!&rdquo;&nbsp; We have attacked
Rome too often on shallow grounds, and finding our arguments weak, have
found it necessary to overstate them.&nbsp; We have got angry, and caught
up the first weapon which came to hand, and have only cut our own fingers.&nbsp;
We have very nearly burnt the Church of England over our heads, in our
hurry to make a bonfire of the Pope.&nbsp; We have been too proud to
make ourselves acquainted with the very tenets which we exposed, and
have made a merit of reading no Popish books but such as we were sure
would give us a handle for attack, and not even them without the precaution
of getting into a safe passion beforehand.&nbsp; We have dealt in exaggerations,
in special pleadings, in vile and reckless imputations of motive, in
suppressions of all palliating facts.&nbsp; We have outraged the common
feelings of humanity by remaining blind to the virtues of noble and
holy men because they were Papists, as if a good deed was not good in
Italy as well as in England.&nbsp; We have talked as if God had doomed
to hopeless vileness in this world and reprobation in the next millions
of Christian people, simply because they were born of Romish and not
of Protestant fathers.&nbsp; And we have our reward; we have fared like
the old woman who would not tell the children what a well was for fear
they should fall into one.&nbsp; We see educated and pious Englishmen
joining the Romish communion simply from ignorance of Rome, and have
no talisman wherewith to disenchant them.&nbsp; Our medicines produce
no effect on them, and all we can do is, like quacks, to increase the
dose.&nbsp; Of course, if ten boxes of Morison&rsquo;s pills have killed
a man, it only proves that&mdash;he ought to have taken twelve of them.&nbsp;
We are jesting, but, as an Ulster Orangeman would say, &ldquo;it is
in good Protestant earnest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the meantime some of the deepest cravings of the human heart have
been left utterly unsatisfied.&nbsp; And be it remembered, that such
universal cravings are more than fancies; they are indications of deep
spiritual wants, which, unless we supply them with the good food which
God has made for them, will supply themselves with poison&mdash;indications
of spiritual faculties, which it is as wicked to stunt or distort by
mis-education as it is to maim our own limbs or stupefy our understanding.&nbsp;
Our humanity is an awful and divine gift; our business is to educate
it throughout&mdash;God alone must judge which part of it shall preponderate
over the rest.&nbsp; But in the last generation&mdash;and, alas! in
this also&mdash;little or no proper care has been taken of the love
for all which is romantic, marvellous, heroic, which exists in every
ingenuous child.&nbsp; Schoolboys, indeed, might, if they chose, in
play-hours, gloat over the &ldquo;Seven Champions of Christendom,&rdquo;
or Lempri&egrave;re&rsquo;s gods and goddesses; girls might, perhaps,
be allowed to devour by stealth a few fairy tales, or the &ldquo;Arabian
Nights;&rdquo; but it was only by connivance that their longings were
satisfied from the scraps of Moslemism, Paganism&mdash;anywhere but
from Christianity.&nbsp; Protestantism had nothing to do with the imagination&mdash;in
fact, it was a question whether reasonable people had any; whether the
devil was not the original maker of that troublesome faculty in man,
woman, and child.&nbsp; Poetry itself was, with most parents, a dram,
to be given, like Dalby&rsquo;s Carminative, as a <i>pis-aller</i>,
when children could not possibly be kept quiet by Miss Edgeworth or
Mrs. Mangnall.&nbsp; Then, as the children grew up, and began to know
something of history and art, two still higher cravings began to seize
on many of them, if they were at all of deep and earnest character:
a desire to associate with religion their new love for the beautiful,
and a reverence for antiquity; a wish to find some bond of union between
themselves and the fifteen centuries of Christianity which elapsed before
the Reformation.&nbsp; They applied to Protestant teachers and Protestant
books, and received too often the answer that the Gospel had nothing
to do with art&mdash;art was either Pagan or Popish; and as for the
centuries before the Reformation, they and all in them belonged utterly
to darkness and the pit.&nbsp; As for the heroes of early Christianity,
they were madmen or humbugs; their legends, devilish and filthy puerilities.&nbsp;
They went to the artists and literary men, and received the same answer.&nbsp;
The medieval writers were fools.&nbsp; Classical art was the only art;
all painters before the age of Raphael superstitious bunglers.&nbsp;
To be sure, as Fuseli said, Christianity had helped art a little; but
then it was the Christianity of Julio and Leone&mdash;in short, of the
worst age of Popery.</p>
<p>These falsehoods have worked out their own punishment.&nbsp; The
young are examining for themselves, and finding that we have deceived
them, a revulsion in their feelings has taken place, similar to that
which took place in Germany some half-century ago.&nbsp; They are reading
the histories of the Middle Ages, and if we call them barbarous&mdash;they
will grant it, and then quote instances of individual heroism and piety,
which they defy us or any honest man not to admire.&nbsp; They are reading
the old legends, and when we call them superstitious&mdash;they grant
it, and then produce passages in which the highest doctrines of Christianity
are embodied in the most pathetic and noble stories.&nbsp; They are
looking for themselves at the ante-Raphaellic artists, and when we tell
them that Fra Angelico&rsquo;s pictures are weak, affected, ill-drawn,
ill-coloured&mdash;they grant it, and then ask us if we can deny the
sweetness, the purity, the rapt devotion, the saintly virtue, which
shines forth from his faces.&nbsp; They ask us how beautiful and holy
words or figures can be inspired by an evil spirit.&nbsp; They ask us
why they are to deny the excellence of tales and pictures which make
men more pure and humble, more earnest and noble.&nbsp; They tell us
truly that all beauty is God&rsquo;s stamp, and that all beauty ought
to be consecrated to his service.&nbsp; And then they ask us: &ldquo;If
Protestantism denies that she can consecrate the beautiful, how can
you wonder if we love the Romanism which can?&nbsp; You say that Popery
created these glorious schools of art; how can you wonder if, like Overbeck,
&ldquo;we take the faith for the sake of the art which it inspired?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To all which, be it true or false (and it is both), are we to answer
merely by shutting our eyes and ears tight, and yelling &ldquo;No Popery!&rdquo;
or are we to say boldly to them: &ldquo;We confess ourselves in fault;
we sympathise with your longings; we confess that Protestantism has
not satisfied them; but we assert that the only cause is, that Protestantism
has not been true to herself; that Art, like every other product of
the free human spirit, is her domain and not Popery&rsquo;s; that these
legends, these pictures, are beautiful just in as far as they contain
in them the germs of those eternal truths about man, nature, and God,
which the Reformation delivered from bondage; that you can admire them,
and yet remain thorough Protestants; and more, that unless you do remain
Protestants, you will never enter into their full beauty and significance,
because you will lose sight of those very facts and ideas from which
they derive all their healthy power over you&rdquo;?</p>
<p>These thoughts are not our own; they are uttered all over England,
thank God! just now, by many voices and in many forms; if they had been
boldly spoken during the last fifteen years, many a noble spirit, we
believe, might have remained in the Church of its fathers which has
now taken refuge in Romanism from the fruits of mis-education.&nbsp;
One great reason why Romanism has been suffered to drag on its existence
is, we humbly think, that it might force us at last to say this: We
have been long learning the lesson; till we have learnt it thoroughly
Romanism will exist, and we shall never be safe from its allurements.</p>
<p>These thoughts may help to explain our opening sentences, as well
as the extreme pleasure with which we hail the appearance of Mrs. Jameson&rsquo;s
work.</p>
<p>The authoress has been struck, during her examination of the works
of Christian artists, with the extreme ignorance which prevails in England
on the subjects which they portray.</p>
<p>We have had (she says, in an introduction, every word of which we
recommend as replete with the truest Christian philosophy)&mdash;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Inquiries into the Principles of Taste, treatises on the Sublime
and Beautiful, Anecdotes of Painting, and we abound in antiquarian essays
on disputed pictures and mutilated statues; but up to a late period
any inquiry into the true spirit and significance of works of art, as
connected with the history of religion and civilisation, would have
appeared ridiculous or, perhaps, dangerous.&nbsp; We should have had
another cry of &ldquo;No Popery!&rdquo; and Acts of Parliament prohibiting
the importation of saints and Madonnas.&mdash;P. xxi.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>And what should we have gained by it, but more ignorance of the excuses
for Popery, and, therefore, of its real dangers?&nbsp; If Protestantism
be the truth, knowledge of whatsoever kind can only further it.&nbsp;
We have found it so in the case of classical literature.&nbsp; Why should
we strain at a gnat and swallow a camel?&nbsp; Our boys have not taken
to worshipping Jupiter and Juno by reading about them.&nbsp; We never
feared that they would.&nbsp; We knew that we should not make them pagans
by teaching them justly to admire the poetry, the philosophy, the personal
virtues of pagans.&nbsp; And, in fact, the few who since the revival
of letters have deserted Christianity for what they called philosophic
heathenism, have in almost every case sympathised, not with the excellences,
but with the worst vices of the Greek and Roman.&nbsp; They have been
men like Leo X. or the Medici, who, ready to be profligates under any
religion, found in heathenism only an excuse for their darling sins.&nbsp;
The same will be the fruits of a real understanding of the medieval
religion.&nbsp; It will only endanger those who carried already the
danger in themselves, and would have fallen into some other snare if
this had been away.&nbsp; Why should we fancy that Protestantism, like
the Romanism which it opposes, is a plant that will not bear the light,
and can only be protected at the expense of the knowledge of facts?&nbsp;
Why will we forgot the great spiritual law which Mrs. Jameson and others
in these days are fully recognising, that &ldquo;we cannot safely combat
the errors of any man or system without first giving them full credit
for whatever excellences they may retain&rdquo;?&nbsp; Such a course
is the true fruit of that free spirit of Protestantism which ought to
delight in recognising good to whatever party it may belong; which asserts
that every good gift and perfect gift comes directly from above, and
not through the channel of particular formularies or priesthoods; which,
because it loves faith and virtue, for their own sakes, and not as mere
parts of a &ldquo;Catholic system,&rdquo; can recognise them and delight
in them wherever it finds them.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Upon these creations of ancient art (as Mrs. Jameson says) we cannot
look as those did for whom they were created; we cannot annihilate the
centuries which lie between us and them; we cannot in simplicity of
heart, forget the artist in the image he has placed before us, nor supply
what may be deficient in his work through a reverentially excited fancy.&nbsp;
We are critical, not credulous.&nbsp; We no longer accept this polytheistic
form of Christianity; and there is little danger, I suppose, of our
falling again into the strange excesses of superstition to which it
led.&nbsp; But if I have not much sympathy with modern imitations of
medieval art, still less can I sympathise with that narrow puritanical
jealousy which holds the monuments of a real and earnest faith in contempt:
all that God has permitted to exist once in the past should be considered
as the possession of the present; sacred for example or warning, and
held as the foundation on which to build up what is better and purer.&mdash;Introd.
p. xx.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Mrs. Jameson here speaks in the name of a large and rapidly-increasing
class.&nbsp; The craving for religious art, of which we spoke above,
is spreading far and wide; even in dissenting chapels we see occasional
attempts at architectural splendour, which would have been considered
twenty years ago heretical or idolatrous.&nbsp; And yet with all this
there is, as Mrs. Jameson says, a curious ignorance with regard to the
subject of medieval art, even though it has now become a reigning fashion
among us.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>We have learned, perhaps, after running through half the galleries
and churches in Europe, to distinguish a few of the attributes and characteristic
figures which meet us at every turn, yet without any clear idea of their
meaning, derivation, or relative propriety.&nbsp; The palm of victory,
we know, designates the martyr, triumphant in death.&nbsp; We so far
emulate the critical sagacity of the gardener in &ldquo;Zeluco,&rdquo;
that we have learned to distinguish St. Laurence by his gridiron, and
St. Catherine by her wheel.&nbsp; We are not at a loss to recognise
the Magdalene&rsquo;s &ldquo;loose hair and lifted eye,&rdquo; even
when without her skull and her vase of ointment.&nbsp; We learn to know
St. Francis by his brown habit, and shaven crown, and wasted ardent
features; but how do we distinguish him from St. Anthony, or St. Dominick?&nbsp;
As for St. George and the Dragon&mdash;from the St. George of the Louvre&mdash;Raphael&rsquo;s&mdash;who
sits his horse with the elegant tranquillity of one assured of celestial
aid, down to him &ldquo;who swings on a sign-post at mine hostess&rsquo;s
door&rdquo;&mdash;he is our familiar acquaintance.&nbsp; But who is
that lovely being in the first blush of youth, who, bearing aloft the
symbolic cross, stands with one foot on the vanquished dragon?&nbsp;
&ldquo;That is a copy after Raphael.&rdquo;&nbsp; And who is that majestic
creature holding her palm-branch, while the unicorn crouches at her
feet?&nbsp; &ldquo;That is the famous Moretto at Vienna.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Are we satisfied?&nbsp; Not in the least! but we try to look wiser and
pass on.</p>
<p>In the old times, the painters of these legendary scenes and subjects
could always reckon securely on certain associations and certain sympathies
in the minds of the spectators.&nbsp; We have outgrown these associations,
we repudiate these sympathies.&nbsp; We have taken these works from
their consecrated localities, in which they once held each their dedicated
place, and we have hung them in our drawing-rooms and our dressing-rooms,
over our pianos and our sideboards, and now what do they say to us?&nbsp;
That Magdalene weeping amid her hair, who once spoke comfort to the
soul of the fallen sinner,&mdash;that Sebastian, arrow-pierced, whose
upward ardent glance, spoke of courage and hope to the tyrant-ridden
serf&mdash;that poor tortured slave to whose aid St. Mark comes sweeping
down from above&mdash;can they speak to us of nothing save flowing lines,
and correct drawing, and gorgeous colour?&nbsp; Must we be told that
one is a Titian, the other a Guido, the third a Tintoret, before we
dare to melt into compassion or admiration? or the moment we refer to
their ancient religious signification and influence, must it be with
disdain or with pity?&nbsp; This, as it appears to me, is to take not
a rational, but rather a most irrational, as well as a most irreverent,
view of the question: it is to confine the pleasure and improvement
to be derived from works of art within very narrow bounds; it is to
seal up a fountain of the richest poetry, and to shut out a thousand
ennobling and inspiring thoughts.&nbsp; Happily there is a growing appreciation
of these larger principles of criticism as applied to the study of art.&nbsp;
People look at the pictures which hang round their walls, and have an
awakening suspicion that there is more in them than meets the eye&mdash;more
than mere connoisseurship can interpret; and that they have another,
a deeper significance than has been dreamed of by picture dealers and
picture collectors, or even picture critics.&mdash;Introd. xxiii.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>On these grounds Mrs. Jameson treats of the Poetry of Sacred and
Legendary Art.&nbsp; Her first volume contains a general sketch of the
legends connected with angels, with the scriptural personages, and the
primitive fathers.&nbsp; Her second, the histories of most of &ldquo;those
sainted personages who lived, or are supposed to have lived, in the
first ages of Christianity, and whose real history, founded on fact
or tradition, has been so disfigured by poetical embroidery that they
have in some sort the air of ideal beings.&rdquo;&nbsp; Each story is
followed by a series of short but brilliant criticisms on those pictures
in which the story has been embodied by painters of various schools
and periods, and illustrated by numerous spirited etchings and woodcuts,
which add greatly to the value and intelligibility of the work.&nbsp;
A future volume is promised which shall contain the &ldquo;legends of
the monastic orders, and the history of the Franciscans and the Dominicans,
considered merely in their connection with the revival and the development
of the fine arts in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries&rdquo;&mdash;a
work which, if it equal the one before us, will doubtless be hailed
by those conversant with that wonderful phase of human history as a
valuable addition to our psychologic and &aelig;sthetic literature.</p>
<p>We ought to petition, also, for a volume which should contain the
life of the Saviour, and the legends of the Virgin Mary; though this
latter subject, we are afraid, will be too difficult for even Mrs. Jameson&rsquo;s
tact and delicacy to make tolerable to English readers, so thoroughly
has the Virgin Mary, as especial patroness of purity, been intermixed
in her legends with every form of prudish and prurient foulmindedness.
<a name="citation199"></a><a href="#footnote199">{199}</a></p>
<p>The authoress has wisely abstained from all controversial matters.&nbsp;
In her preface she begs that it may be clearly understood, &ldquo;that
she has taken throughout the &aelig;sthetic and not the religious view
of these productions of art; which, in as far as they are informed with
a true and earnest feeling, and steeped in that beauty which emanates
from Genius inspired by Faith, may cease to be religion, but cannot
cease to be poetry; and as poetry only,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;I have
considered them.&rdquo;&nbsp; In a word, Mrs. Jameson has done for them
what schoolmasters and schoolboys, bishops and Royal Academicians, have
been doing for centuries, by Greek plays and Greek statues, without
having incurred, as we said above, the slightest suspicion of wanting
to worship heathen gods and goddesses.</p>
<p>Not that she views these stories with the cold unbelieving eye of
a Goethe, merely as studies of &ldquo;artistic effect;&rdquo; she often
transgresses her rule of impartiality, and just where we should wish
her to do so.&nbsp; Her geniality cannot avoid an occasional burst of
feeling, such as concludes her notice of the stories about the Magdalene
and the other &ldquo;beatified penitents.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Poets have sung, and moralists and sages have taught, that for the
frail woman there was nothing left but to die; or if more remained for
her to suffer, there was at least nothing left for her to be or do&mdash;no
choice between sackcloth and ashes and the livery of sin.&nbsp; The
beatified penitents of the early Christian Church spoke another lesson&mdash;spoke
divinely of hope for the fallen, hope without self-abasement or defiance.&nbsp;
We, in these days, acknowledge no such saints; we have even done our
best to dethrone Mary Magdalene; but we have martyrs&mdash;&ldquo;by
the pang without the palm&rdquo;&mdash;and one, at least, among these
who has not died without lifting up a voice of eloquent and solemn warning;
who has borne her palm on earth, and whose starry crown may be seen
on high even now amid the constellations of Genius.&mdash;Vol. ii. p.
386.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>To whom the authoress may allude in this touching passage our simplicity
cannot guess in the least.&nbsp; We may, therefore, without the suspicion
of partiality, say to the noble spirit of purity, compassion, and true
liberality which breathes throughout this whole chapter, &ldquo;Go on
and conquer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nor again can Mrs. Jameson&rsquo;s English honesty avoid an occasional
slip of delicate sarcasm; for instance, in the story of St. Filomena,
a brand-new saint, whose discovery at Rome, in 1802, produced there
an excitement which we should suspect was very much wanted, which we
recommend to all our readers as an instance of the state into which
the virtues of honesty and common sense seem to have fallen in the Eternal
City&mdash;of humbugs.</p>
<p>No doubt there are many such cases of imposture among the list of
saints and martyrs; yet, granting all which have been exposed, and more,
there still remains a list of authentic stories, sadder and stranger
than any romance of man&rsquo;s invention, to read which without deep
sympathy and admiration our hearts must be callous or bigoted indeed.&nbsp;
As Mrs. Jameson herself well says (vol. ii. p. 137):</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>When in the daily service of our Church we repeat these words of
the sublime hymn (&ldquo;The noble army of martyrs praise Thee!&rdquo;),
I wonder sometimes whether it be with a full appreciation of their meaning?
whether we do really reflect on all that this noble army of martyrs
has conquered for us?&nbsp; Did they indeed glorify God through their
courage, and seal their faith in their Redeemer with their blood?&nbsp;
And if it be so, how is it that we Christians have learned to look coldly
upon the effigies of those who sowed the seed of the harvest which we
have reaped?&mdash;Sanguis martyrum semen Christianorum!&nbsp; We may
admit that the reverence paid to them in former days was unreasonable
and excessive; that credulity and ignorance have in many instances falsified
the actions imputed to them; that enthusiasm has magnified their numbers
beyond all belief; that when the communion with martyrs was associated
with the presence of their material remains, the passion for relics
led to a thousand abuses, and the belief in their intercession to a
thousand superstitions.&nbsp; But why, in uprooting the false, uproot
also the beautiful and the true?</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Thoroughly and practically convinced as we are of the truth of these
words, it gave us some pain when, in the work of a very worthy person,
&ldquo;The Church in the Catacombs,&rdquo; by Dr. Maitland (not the
author of &ldquo;The Dark Ages&rdquo;), we found, as far as we could
perceive, a wish &ldquo;to advance the Protestant cause,&rdquo; by throwing
general doubt on the old martyrologies and their monuments in the Roman
catacombs.&nbsp; If we shall have judged hastily, we shall be ready
to apologise.&nbsp; None, as we have said before, more firmly believe
that the Protestant cause is the good cause; none are more reverentially
inclined toward all honest critical investigations, more anxious to
see all truth, the Bible itself, sifted and tested in every possible
method; but we must protest against what certainly seems too contemptuous
a rejection of a mass of historic evidence hitherto undoubted, except
by the school of Voltaire; and of the hasty denial of the meaning of
Christian and martyrologic symbols, as well known to antiquaries as
Stonehenge or Magna Charta.</p>
<p>At the same time, Dr. Maitland&rsquo;s book seems the work of a righteous
and earnest man, and it is not its object, but its method, of which
we complain.&nbsp; The whole question of martyrology, a far more important
one than historians generally fancy, requires a thorough investigation,
critical and historical; it has to be done, and especially just now.&nbsp;
The Germans, the civil engineers of the intellectual world, ought to
do it for us, and no doubt will.&nbsp; But those who undertake it must
bring to the work, not only impartiality, but enthusiasm; it is the
spirit only, after all, which can quicken the eye, which can free the
understanding from the idols of laziness, prejudice, and hasty induction.&nbsp;
To talk philosophically of such matters a man must love them; he must
set to work with a Christian sympathy, and a manly admiration for those
old spiritual heroes to whose virtue and endurance Europe owes it that
she is not now a den of heathen savages.&nbsp; He must be ready to assume
everything about them to be true which is neither absurd, immoral, nor
unsupported by the same amount of evidence which he would require for
any other historic fact.&nbsp; And, just because this very tone of mind&mdash;enthusiastic
but not idolatrous, discriminating but not captious&mdash;runs through
Mrs. Jameson&rsquo;s work, we hail it with especial pleasure, as a fresh
move in a truly philosophic and Christian direction.&nbsp; Indeed, for
that branch of the subject which she has taken in hand, not the history,
but the poetry of legends and of the art which they awakened, she derives
a peculiar fitness, not merely from her own literary talents and acquaintance
with continental art, but also from the very fact of her being an English
wife and mother.&nbsp; Women ought, perhaps, always to make the best
critics&mdash;at once more quicksighted, more tasteful, more sympathetic
than ourselves, whose proper business is creation.&nbsp; Perhaps in
Utopia they will take the reviewer&rsquo;s business entirely off our
hands, as they are said to be doing already, by-the-bye, in one leading
periodical.&nbsp; But of all critics an English matron ought to be the
best&mdash;open as she should be, by her womanhood, to all tender and
admiring sympathies, accustomed by her Protestant education to unsullied
purity of thought, and inheriting from her race, not only freedom of
mind and reverence for antiquity, but the far higher birthright of English
honesty.</p>
<p>And such a genial and honest spirit, we think, runs through this
book.</p>
<p>Another difficult task, perhaps the most difficult of all, the authoress
has well performed.&nbsp; We mean the handling of stories whose facts
she partly or wholly disbelieves, while she admires and loves their
spirit and moral; or doctrines, to pronounce on whose truth or falsehood
is beyond her subject.&nbsp; This difficulty Mr. Newman, in the &ldquo;Lives
of the English Saints,&rdquo; edited and partly written by him, turned
with wonderful astuteness to the advantage of Romanism; but others,
more honest, have not been so victorious.&nbsp; Witness the painfully
uncertain impression left by some parts of one or two of those masterly
articles on Romish heroes which appeared in the &ldquo;Quarterly Review;&rdquo;
an uncertainty which we have the fullest reason to believe was most
foreign to the reviewer&rsquo;s mind and conscience.&nbsp; Even Mr.
Macaulay&rsquo;s brilliant history here and there falls into the same
snare.&nbsp; No one but those who have tried it can be aware of the
extreme difficulty of preventing the dramatic historian from degenerating
into an apologist or heating into a sneerer; or understand the ease
with which an earnest author, in a case like the present, becomes frantically
reckless, under the certainty that, say what he will, he will be called
a Jesuit by the Protestants, an Infidel by the Papists, a Pantheist
by the Ultra-High-Church, and a Rogue by all three.</p>
<p>Now, we certainly shall not say that Mrs. Jameson is greater than
the writers just mentioned; but we must say, that female tact and deep
devotional feeling cut the Gordian knot which has puzzled more cunning
heads.&nbsp; Not that Mrs. Jameson is faultless; we want something yet,
in the telling of a Christian fairy-tale, and know not what we want:
but never were legends narrated with more discernment and simplicity
than these.</p>
<p>As an instance, take the legend of St. Dorothea (vol. ii. p. 184),
which is especially one of those stories of &ldquo;sainted personages
who,&rdquo; as Mrs. Jameson says, &ldquo;lived, or are supposed to have
lived, in the first ages of Christianity: and whose real history, founded
on fact or tradition, has been so disguised by poetical embroidery,
that they have in some sort the air of ideal beings;&rdquo; and which
may, therefore, be taken as a complete test of the authoress&rsquo;s
tact and honesty:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>In the province of Cappadocia and in the city of C&aelig;sarea, dwelt
a noble virgin, whose name was Dorothea.&nbsp; In the whole city there
was none to be compared to her in beauty and grace of person.&nbsp;
She was a Christian, and served God day and night with prayers, with
fasting, and with alms.</p>
<p>The governor of the city, by name Sapritius (or Fabricius), was a
very terrible persecutor of the Christians, and hearing of the maiden,
and of her great beauty, he ordered her to be brought before him.&nbsp;
She came, with her mantle folded on her bosom, and her eyes meekly cast
down.&nbsp; The governor asked &ldquo;Who art thou?&rdquo; and she replied:
&ldquo;I am Dorothea, a virgin, and a servant of Jesus Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He said: &ldquo;Thou must serve our gods, or die.&rdquo;&nbsp; She answered
mildly: &ldquo;Be it so; the sooner shall I stand in the presence of
Him whom I most desire to behold.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then the governor asked
her: &ldquo;Whom meanest thou?&rdquo;&nbsp; She replied: &ldquo;I mean
the Son of God, Christ, mine espoused! his dwelling is paradise; by
his side are joys eternal; and in his garden grow celestial fruits and
roses that never fade.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then Sapritius, overcome by her
eloquence and beauty, ordered her to be carried back to her dungeon.&nbsp;
And he sent to her two sisters, whose names were Calista and Christeta,
who had once been Christians, but who, from terror of the torments with
which they were threatened, had renounced their faith in Christ.&nbsp;
To these women the governor promised large rewards if they would induce
Dorothea to follow their evil example; and they, nothing doubting of
success, boldly undertook the task.&nbsp; The result, however, was far
different; for Dorothea, full of courage and constancy, reproved them,
as one having authority, and drew such a picture of the joys they had
forfeited through their falsehood and cowardice, that they fell at her
feet, saying: &ldquo;O blessed Dorothea, pray for us, that, through
thy intercession, our sins may be forgiven and our penitence accepted!&rdquo;&nbsp;
And she did so.&nbsp; And when they had left the dungeon they proclaimed
aloud that they were servants of Christ.</p>
<p>Then the governor, furious, commanded that they should be burned,
and that Dorothea should witness their torments.&nbsp; And she stood
by, bravely encouraging them, and saying: &ldquo;O my sisters, fear
not! suffer to the end! for these transient pangs shall be followed
by the joys of eternal life!&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus they died: and Dorothea
herself was condemned to be tortured cruelly, and then beheaded.&nbsp;
The first part of her sentence she endured with invincible fortitude.&nbsp;
She was then led forth to death; and, as she went, a young man, a lawyer
of the city named Theophilus, who had been present when she was first
brought before the governor, called to her mockingly: &ldquo;Ha! fair
maiden, goest thou to join thy bridegroom?&nbsp; Send me, I pray thee,
of the fruits and flowers of that same garden of which thou hast spoken:
I would fain taste of them!&rdquo;&nbsp; And Dorothea looking on him
inclined her head with a gentle smile, and said: &ldquo;Thy request,
O Theophilus, is granted!&rdquo;&nbsp; Whereat he laughed aloud with
his companions; but she went on cheerfully to death.</p>
<p>When she came to the place of execution, she knelt down and prayed;
and suddenly appeared at her side a beautiful boy, with hair bright
as sunbeams:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>A smooth-faced glorious thing,<br />With thousand blessings dancing
in his eyes.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>In his hand he held a basket containing three apples, and three fresh-gathered
and fragrant roses.&nbsp; She said to him; &ldquo;Carry these to Theophilus;
say that Dorothea hath sent them, and that I go before him to the garden
whence they came, and await him there.&rdquo;&nbsp; With these words
she bent her neck, and received the death-stroke.</p>
<p>Meantime the angel (for it was an angel) went to seek Theophilus,
and found him still laughing in merry mood over the idea of the promised
gift.&nbsp; The angel placed before him the basket of celestial fruit
and flowers, saying: &ldquo;Dorothea sends thee this,&rdquo; and vanished.&nbsp;
What words can express the wonder of Theophilus?&nbsp; Struck by the
prodigy operated in his favour, his heart melted within him; he tasted
of the celestial fruit, and a new life was his; he proclaimed himself
a servant of Christ, and, following the example of Dorothea, suffered
with like constancy in the cause of truth, and obtained the crown of
martyrdom.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>We have chosen this legend just because it is in itself as superstitious
and fantastic as any in the book.&nbsp; We happen to hold the dream
of &ldquo;The Spiritual Marriage,&rdquo; as there set forth, in especial
abhorrence, and we have no doubt Mrs. Jameson does so also.&nbsp; We
are well aware of the pernicious effect which this doctrine has exercised
on matrimonial purity among the southern nations; that by making chastity
synonymous with celibacy, it degraded married faithfulness into a restriction
which there were penalties for breaking, but no rewards for keeping.&nbsp;
We see clearly enough the cowardice, the shortsightedness, of fancying
that man can insure the safety of his soul by fleeing from the world&mdash;in
plain English, deserting the post to which God has called him, like
the monks and nuns of old.&nbsp; We believe that the numbers of the
early martyrs have been exaggerated.&nbsp; We believe that they were
like ourselves, imperfect and inconsistent human beings; that, on the
showing of the legends and fathers themselves, their testimony for the
truth was too often impaired by superstition, fanaticism, or passion.&nbsp;
But granting all this, we must still say, in the words of one who cannot
be suspected of Romanising&mdash;the great Dr. Arnold&mdash;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Divide the sum total of reported martyrs by twenty; by fifty, if
you will; after all, you have a number of persons of all ages and sexes
suffering cruel torments and deaths for conscience&rsquo; sake, and
for Christ&rsquo;s; and by their sufferings, manifestly with God&rsquo;s
blessing, insuring the triumph of Christ&rsquo;s Gospel.&nbsp; Neither
do I think that we consider the excellence of this martyr spirit half
enough.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Indeed we do not.&nbsp; Let all the abatements mentioned above, and
more, be granted; yet, even then, when we remember that the world from
which Jerome or Anthony fled was even worse than that denounced by Juvenal
and Persius&mdash;that the nuptials which, as legends say, were often
offered the virgin martyrs as alternatives for death, were such as employed
the foul pens of Petronius and Martial&mdash;that the tyrants whom they
spurned were such as live in the pages of Suetonius, and the August&aelig;
Histori&aelig; Scriptores&mdash;that the gods whom they were commanded
to worship, the rites in which they were to join, were those over which
Ovid and Apuleius had gloated, which Lucian had held up to the contempt
of heathendom itself&mdash;that the tortures which they preferred to
apostacy and to foul crimes were, by the confessions of the heathens
themselves, too horrible for pen to tell&mdash;it does raise a flush
of indignation to hear some sleek bigot-sceptic, bred up in the safety
and luxury of modern England, among Habeas Corpus Acts and endowed churches,
trying from his warm fireside to sneer away the awful responsibilities
and the heroic fortitude of valiant men and tender girls, to whose piety
and courage he owes the very enlightenment, the very civilisation, of
which he boasts.</p>
<p>It is an error, doubtless, and a fearful one, to worship even such
as them.&nbsp; But the error, when it arose, was at worst the caricature
of a blessed truth.&nbsp; Even for the sinful, surely it was better
to admire holiness than to worship their own sin.&nbsp; Shame on those
who, calling themselves Christians, repine that a Cecilia or a Magdalen
replaced an Isis and a Venus; or who can fancy that they are serving
Protestantism by tracing malevolent likenesses between even the idolatry
of a saint and the idolatry of a devil!&nbsp; True, there was idolatry
in both, as gross in one as the other.&nbsp; And what wonder?&nbsp;
What wonder if, amid a world of courtesans, the nun was worshipped?&nbsp;
At least God allowed it; and will man be wiser than God?&nbsp; &ldquo;The
times of that ignorance He winked at.&rdquo;&nbsp; The lie that was
in it He did not interfere to punish.&nbsp; He did more; He let it work
out, as all lies will, their own punishment.&nbsp; We may see that in
the miserable century which preceded the glorious Reformation; we may
see it in the present state of Spain and Italy.&nbsp; The crust of lies,
we say, punished itself; to the germ of truth within it we partly owe
that we are Christian men this day.</p>
<p>But granting, or rather boldly asserting all this, and smiling as
much as we choose at the tale of St. Dorothea&rsquo;s celestial basket,
is it not absolutely, and in spite of all, an exquisite story?&nbsp;
Is it likely to make people better or worse?&nbsp; We might believe
the whole of it, and yet we need not, therefore, turn idolaters and
worship sweet Dorothea for a goddess.&nbsp; But if, as we trust in God
is the case, we are too wise to believe it all&mdash;if even we see
no reason (and there is not much) for believing one single word of it&mdash;yet
still we ask, Is it not an exquisite story?&nbsp; Is there not heroism
in it greater than of all the Ajaxes and Achilles who ever blustered
on this earth?&nbsp; Is there not power greater than of kings&mdash;God&rsquo;s
strength made perfect in woman&rsquo;s weakness?&nbsp; Tender forgiveness,
the Saviour&rsquo;s own likeness; glimpses, brilliant and true at the
core, however distorted and miscoloured, of that spiritual world where
the wicked cease from troubling, where the meek alone shall inherit
the earth, where, as Protestants too believe, all that is spotless and
beautiful in nature as well as in man shall bloom for ever perfect?</p>
<p>It is especially in her descriptions of paintings that Mrs. Jameson&rsquo;s
great talents are displayed.&nbsp; Nowhere do we recollect criticisms
more genial, brilliant, picturesque than those which are scattered through
these pages.&nbsp; Often they have deeper merits, and descend to those
fundamental laws of beauty and of religion by which all Christian art
must ultimately be tested.&nbsp; Mrs. Jameson has certainly a powerful
inductive faculty; she comprehends at once the idea <a name="citation210"></a><a href="#footnote210">{210}</a>
and central law of a work of art, and sketches it in a few vivid and
masterly touches; and really, to use a hack quotation honestly for once,
&ldquo;in thoughts which breathe, and words which burn.&rdquo;&nbsp;
As an instance, we must be allowed to quote at length this charming
passage on angel paintings, so valuable does it seem not only as information,
but as a specimen of what criticism should be:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>On the revival of art, we find the Byzantine idea of angels everywhere
prevailing.&nbsp; The angels in Cimabue&rsquo;s famous &ldquo;Virgin
and Child enthroned&rdquo; are grand creatures, rather stern, but this
arose, I think, from his inability to express beauty.&nbsp; The colossal
angels at Assisi, solemn sceptred kingly forms, all alike in action
and attitude, appeared to me magnificent.</p>
<p>In the angels of Giotto we see the commencement of a softer grace
and a purer taste, further developed by some of his scholars.&nbsp;
Benozzo Gozzoli and Orcagna have left in the Campo Santo examples of
the most graceful and fanciful treatment.&nbsp; Of Benozzo&rsquo;s angels
in the Ricardi Palace I have spoken at length.&nbsp; His master, Angelico
(worthy the name!), never reached the same power of expressing the rapturous
rejoicing of celestial beings, but his conception of the angelic nature
remains unapproached, unapproachable: it is only his, for it was the
gentle, passionless, refined nature of the recluse which stamped itself
there.&nbsp; Angelico&rsquo;s angels are unearthly, not so much in form
as in sentiment; and superhuman, not in power but in purity.&nbsp; In
other hands, any imitation of his soft ethereal grace would become feeble
and insipid.&nbsp; With their long robes falling round their feet, and
drooping many-coloured wings, they seem not to fly or to walk, but to
float along, &ldquo;smooth sliding without step.&rdquo;&nbsp; Blessed
blessed creatures! love us, only love us! for we dare not task your
soft serene beatitude, by asking you to help us!</p>
<p>There is more sympathy with humanity in Francia&rsquo;s angels: they
look as if they could weep as well as love and sing.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Correggio&rsquo;s angels are grand and lovely, but they are like
children enlarged and sublimated, not like spirits taking the form of
children; where they smile it is truly&mdash;as Annibal Caracci expresses
it&mdash;con una naturalezza et simplicit&agrave; che innamora e sforza
a ridere con loro: but the smile in many of Correggio&rsquo;s angel
heads has something sublime and spiritual, as well as simple and natural.</p>
<p>And Titian&rsquo;s angels impress me in a similar manner&mdash;I
mean those in the glorious &ldquo;Assumption&rdquo; at Venice&mdash;with
their childish forms and features, but an expression caught from beholding
the face of &ldquo;our Father that is in heaven:&rdquo; it is glorified
in fancy.&nbsp; I remember standing before this picture, contemplating
those lovely spirits, one after another, until a thrill came over me
like that which I felt when Mendelssohn played the organ&mdash;I became
music while I listened.&nbsp; The face of one of those angels is to
the face of a child just what that of the Virgin in the same picture
is compared with the fairest of the daughters of earth: it is not here
superiority of beauty, but mind, and music, and love kneaded, as it
were, into form and colour.</p>
<p>But Raphael, excelling in all things, is here excellent above all;
his angels combine in a higher degree than any other, the various faculties
and attributes in which the fancy loves to clothe these pure, immortal,
beatified creatures.&nbsp; The angels of Giotti, of Benozzo, of Fiesole,
are, if not female, feminine; those of Filippo Lippi and of Andrea,
masculine; but you cannot say of those of Raphael, that they are masculine
or feminine.&nbsp; The idea of sex is wholly lost in the blending of
power, intelligence, and grace.&nbsp; In his early pictures, grace is
the predominant characteristic, as in the dancing and singing angels
in his &ldquo;Coronation of the Virgin.&rdquo;&nbsp; In his later pictures
the sentiment in his ministering angels is more spiritual, more dignified.&nbsp;
As a perfect example of grand and poetical feeling, I may cite the angels
as &ldquo;Regents of the Planets,&rdquo; in the Capella Chigiana.&nbsp;
The cupola represents in a circle the creation of the solar system,
according to the theological and astronomical (or rather astrological)
notions which then prevailed&mdash;a hundred years before &ldquo;the
starry Galileo and his woes.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the centre is the Creator;
around, in eight compartments, we have, first, the angel of the celestial
sphere, who seems to be listening to the divine mandate: &ldquo;Let
there be light in the firmament of heaven;&rdquo; then follow in their
order, the Sun, the Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.&nbsp;
The name of each planet is expressed by its mythological representative;
the Sun by Apollo, the Moon by Diana: and over each presides a grand
colossal-winged spirit, seated or reclining on a portion of the zodiac
as on a throne.&nbsp; I have selected two angels to give an idea of
this peculiar and poetical treatment.&nbsp; The union of the theological
and the mythological attributes is in the classical taste of the time,
and quite Miltonic.&nbsp; In Raphael&rsquo;s child-angels, the expression
of power and intelligence, as well as innocence, is quite wonderful;
for instance, look at the two angel-boys, in the Dresden Madonna di
San Sisto, and the angels, or celestial genii, who bear along the Almighty
when he appears to Noah.&nbsp; No one has expressed like Raphael the
action of flight, except perhaps Rembrandt.&nbsp; The angel who descends
to crown Santa Felicit&agrave; cleaves the air with the action of a
swallow: and the angel in Rembrandt&rsquo;s Tobit soars like a lark
with upward motion, spurning the earth.</p>
<p>Michael Angelo rarely gave wings to his angels; I scarcely recollect
an instance, except the angel in the &ldquo;Annunciation:&rdquo; and
his exaggerated human forms, his colossal creatures, in which the idea
of power is conveyed through attitude and muscular action, are, to my
taste, worse than unpleasing.&nbsp; My admiration for this wonderful
man is so profound that I can afford to say this.&nbsp; His angels are
superhuman, but hardly angelic: and while in Raphael&rsquo;s angels
we do not feel the want of wings, we feel while looking at those of
Michael Angelo that not even the &ldquo;sail-broad vans&rdquo; with
which Satan laboured, through the surging abyss of chaos could suffice
to lift those Titanic forms from earth, and sustain them in mid-air.&nbsp;
The group of angels over the &ldquo;Last Judgment,&rdquo; flinging their
mighty limbs about, and those that surround the descending figure of
Christ in the &ldquo;Conversion of St. Paul,&rdquo; may be referred
to here as characteristic examples.&nbsp; The angels, blowing their
trumpets, puff and strain like so many troopers.&nbsp; Surely this is
not angelic: there may be power&mdash;great, imaginative, and artistic
power&mdash;exhibited in the conception of form, but in the beings themselves
there is more of effort than of power: serenity, tranquillity, beatitude,
ethereal purity, spiritual grace, are out of the question.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>In this passage we may remark an excellence in Mrs. Jameson&rsquo;s
mode of thought which has become lately somewhat rare.&nbsp; We mean
a freedom from that bigoted and fantastic habit of mind which leads
nowadays the worshippers of high art to exalt the early schools to the
disadvantage of all others, and to talk as if Christian painting had
expired with Perugino.&nbsp; We were much struck with our authoress&rsquo;s
power of finding spiritual truth and beauty in Titian&rsquo;s &ldquo;Assumption,&rdquo;
one of the very pictures in which the &ldquo;high-art&rdquo; party are
wont to see nothing but &ldquo;coarseness&rdquo; and &ldquo;earthliness&rdquo;
of conception.&nbsp; She, having, we suppose, a more acute as well as
a more healthy eye for the beautiful and the spiritual, and therefore
able to perceive its slightest traces wherever they exist, sees in those
&ldquo;earthly&rdquo; faces of the great masters, &ldquo;an expression
caught from beholding the face of our Father that is in heaven.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The face of one of those &ldquo;angels,&rdquo; she continues, &ldquo;is
to the face of a child just what that of the Virgin in the same picture
is compared with the fairest of the daughters of earth: it is not here
superiority of beauty, but mind, and music, and love, kneaded, as it
were, into form and colour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Jameson acknowledges her great obligations to M. Rio; and all
students of art must be thankful to him for the taste, learning, and
earnest religious feeling which he has expended on the history of the
earlier schools of painting.&nbsp; An honest man, doubtless, he is;
but it does not follow, alas! in this piecemeal world, that he should
write an honest book.&nbsp; And his bigotry stands in painful contrast
to the genial and comprehensive spirit by which Mrs. Jameson seems able
to appreciate the specific beauties of all schools and masters.&nbsp;
M. Rio&rsquo;s theory (and he is the spokesman of a large party) is,
unless we much misjudge him, this&mdash;that the ante-Raphaelic is the
only Christian art; and that all the excellences of these early painters
came from their Romanism; all their faults from his two great bugbears&mdash;Byzantinism
and Paganism.&nbsp; In his eyes, the Byzantine idea of art was Manichean;
in which we fully coincide, but add, that the idea of the early Italian
painters was almost equally so: and that almost all in them that was
not Manichean they owe not to their Romanism or their asceticism, but
to their healthy layman&rsquo;s common sense, and to the influence of
that very classical art which they are said to have been pious enough
to despise.&nbsp; Bigoted and ascetic Romanists have been, in all ages,
in a hurry to call people Manicheans, all the more fiercely because
their own consciences must have hinted to them that they were somewhat
Manichean themselves.&nbsp; When a man suspects his own honesty, he
is, of course, inclined to prove himself blameless by shouting the loudest
against the dishonesty of others.&nbsp; Now M. Rio sees clearly and
philosophically enough what is the root of Manicheanism&mdash;the denial
that that which is natural, beautiful, human, belongs to God.&nbsp;
He imputes it justly to those Byzantine artists who fancied it carnal
to attribute beauty to the Saviour or to the Virgin Mary, and tried
to prove their own spirituality by representing their sacred personages
in the extreme of ugliness and emaciation, though some of the specimens
of their painting which Mrs. Jameson gives proves that this abhorrence
of beauty was not so universal as M.&nbsp; Rio would have us believe.&nbsp;
We agree with him that this absurdity was learned from them by earlier
and semi-barbarous Italian artists, that these latter rapidly escaped
from it, and began rightly to embody their conceptions in beautiful
forms; and yet we must urge against them, too, the charge of Manicheanism,
and of a spiritual eclecticism also, far deeper and more pernicious
than the mere outward eclecticism of manner which has drawn down hard
names on the school of the Caracci.</p>
<p>For an eclectic, if it mean, anything, means this&mdash;one who,
in any branch of art or science, refuses to acknowledge Bacon&rsquo;s
great law, &ldquo;that nature is only conquered by obeying her;&rdquo;
who will not take a full and reverent view of the whole mass of facts
with which he has to deal, and from them deducing the fundamental laws
of his subject, obey them whithersoever they may lead; but who picks
and chooses out of them just so many as may be pleasant to his private
taste, and then constructs a partial system which differs from the essential
ideas of nature, in proportion to the number of facts which he has determined
to discard.&nbsp; And such a course was pursued in the art by the ascetic
painters between the time of Giotto and Raphael.&nbsp; Their idea of
beauty was a partial and a Manichean one; in their adoration for a fictitious
&ldquo;angelic nature,&rdquo; made up from all which is negative in
humanity, they were prone to despise all by which man is brought in
contact with this earth&mdash;the beauties of sex, of strength, of activity,
of grandeur of form; all, that is, in which Greek art excels: their
ideal of beauty was altogether effeminate.&nbsp; They prudishly despised
the anatomic study of the human figure, of landscape and chiaroscuro.&nbsp;
Spiritual expression with them was everything; but it was only the expression
of the passive spiritual faculties of innocence, devotion, meekness,
resignation&mdash;all good, but not the whole of humanity.&nbsp; Not
that they could be quite consistent in their theory.&nbsp; They were
forced to paint their very angels as human beings; and a standard of
human beauty they had to find somewhere; and they found one, strange
to say, exactly like that of the old Pagan statues (wings and all&mdash;for
the wings of Christian angels are copied exactly from those of Greek
Genii), and only differing in that ascetic and emasculate tone, which
was peculiar to themselves.&nbsp; Here is a dilemma which the worshippers
of high art have slurred over.&nbsp; Where did Angelico de Fiesole get
the idea of beauty which dictated his exquisite angels?&nbsp; We shall
not, I suppose, agree with those who attribute it to direct inspiration,
and speak of it as the reward of the prayer and fasting by which the
good monk used to prepare himself for painting.&nbsp; Must we then confess
that he borrowed his beauties from the faces of the prettiest nuns with
whom he was acquainted?&nbsp; That would be sad naturalism; and sad
eclecticism too, considering that he must have seen among his Italian
sisters a great many beauties of a very different type from that which
he has chosen to copy; though, we suppose, of God&rsquo;s making equally
with that of his favourites.&nbsp; Or did he, in spite of himself, steal
a side-glance now and then at some of the unrivalled antique statues
of his country, and copy on the sly any feature or proportion in them
which was emasculate enough to be worked into his pictures?&nbsp; That,
too, is likely enough; nay, it is certain.&nbsp; We are perfectly astonished
how any draughtsman, at least how such a critic as M. Rio, can look
at the early Italian painters without tracing everywhere in them the
classic touch, the peculiar tendency to mathematic curves in the outlines,
which is the distinctive peculiarity of Greek art.&nbsp; Is not Giotto,
the father of Italian art, full of it in every line?&nbsp; Is not Perugino?&nbsp;
Is not the angel of Lorenzo Credi in Mrs. Jameson&rsquo;s woodcut?&nbsp;
Is not Francia, except just where he is stiff, and soft, and clumsy?&nbsp;
Is not Fra Angelico himself?&nbsp; Is it not just the absence of this
Greek tendency to mathematical forms in the German painters before Albert
D&uuml;rer, which makes the specific difference, evident to every boy,
between the drawing of the Teutonic and Italian schools?</p>
<p>But if so, what becomes of the theory which calls Pagan art by all
manner of hard names? which dates the downfall of Christian art from
the moment when painters first lent an eye to its pernicious seductions?&nbsp;
How can those escape the charge of eclecticism, who, without going to
the root-idea of Greek art, filched from its outside just as much as
suited their purpose?&nbsp; And how, lastly, can M. Rio&rsquo;s school
of critics escape the charge of Manichean contempt for God&rsquo;s world
and man, not as ascetics have fancied him, but as God has made him,
when they think it a sufficient condemnation of a picture to call it
naturalistic; when they talk and act about art as if the domain of the
beautiful were the devil&rsquo;s kingdom, from which some few species
of form and elements were to be stolen by Christian painters, and twisted
from their original evil destination into the service of religion?</p>
<p>On the other hand, we owe much to those early ascetic painters; their
works are a possession for ever.&nbsp; No future school of religious
art will be able to rise to eminence without taking full cognisance
of them, and learning from them their secret.&nbsp; They taught artists,
and priests, and laymen too, that beauty is only worthy of admiration
when it is the outward sacrament of the beauty of the soul within; they
helped to deliver men from that idolatry to merely animal strength and
loveliness into which they were in danger of falling in ferocious ages,
and among the relics of Roman luxury; they asserted the superiority
of the spirit over the flesh; according to their light, they were faithful
preachers of the great Christian truth, that devoted faith, and not
fierce self-will, is man&rsquo;s glory.&nbsp; Well did their pictures
tell to brutal peasant, and to still more brutal warrior, that God&rsquo;s
might was best shown forth, not in the elephantine pride of a Hercules,
or the Titanic struggles of a Laocoon, but in the weakness of martyred
women, and of warriors who were content meekly to endure shame and death,
for the sake of Him who conquered by sufferings, and bore all human
weaknesses; who &ldquo;was led as a lamb to the slaughter, and, like
a sheep dumb before the shearer, opened not his mouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We must conclude with a few words on one point on which we differ
somewhat from Mrs. Jameson&mdash;the allegoric origin of certain legendary
stories.&nbsp; She calls the story of the fiend, under the form of a
dragon, devouring St. Margaret, and then bursting at the sign of the
cross while the saint escaped unhurt, &ldquo;another form of the familiar
allegory&mdash;the power of Sin overcome by the power of the Cross.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And again, vol. ii. p. 4:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>The legend of St. George came to us from the East; where, under various
forms, as Apollo and the Python, as Bellerophon and the Chim&aelig;ra,
as Perseus and the Sea-monster, we see perpetually recurring the mythic
allegory by which was figured the conquest achieved by beneficent Power
over the tyranny of Wickedness, and which reappears in Christian art
in the legends of St. Michael and half a hundred other saints.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>To us these stories seem to have had by no means an allegorical,
but rather a strictly historic foundation; and our reasons for this
opinion may possibly interest some readers.</p>
<p>Allegory, strictly so called, is the offspring of an advanced, and
not of a semi-barbarous state of society.&nbsp; Its home is in the East&mdash;not
the East of barbarous Pontine countries peopled by men of our own race,
where the legend of St. George is allowed to have sprung up, but of
the civilised, metaphysical, dark-haired races of Egypt, Syria, and
Hindostan.&nbsp; The &ldquo;objectivity&rdquo; of the Gothic mind has
never had any sympathy with it.&nbsp; The Teutonic races, like the earlier
Greeks, before they were tinctured with Eastern thought, had always
wanted historic facts, dates, names, and places.&nbsp; They even found
it necessary to import their saints; to locate Mary Magdalene at Marseilles,
Joseph of Arimathea at Glastonbury, the three Magi at Cologne, before
they could thoroughly love or understand them.&nbsp; Englishmen especially
cannot write allegories.&nbsp; John Bunyan alone succeeded tolerably,
but only because his characters and language were such as he had encountered
daily at every fireside and in. every meeting-house.&nbsp; But Spenser
wandered perpetually away, or rather, rose up from his plan into mere
dramatic narrative.&nbsp; His work and other English allegories, are
hardly allegoric at all, but rather symbolic; spiritual laws in them
are not expressed by arbitrary ciphers, but embodied in imaginary examples,
sufficiently startling or simple to form a plain key to other and deeper
instances of the same law.&nbsp; They are analogous to those symbolic
devotional pictures in which the Madonna and saints of all ages are
grouped together with the painter&rsquo;s own contemporaries&mdash;no
allegories at all, but the plain embodiment of a fact in which the artist
believed; not only &ldquo;the communion of all saints,&rdquo; but also
their habit of assisting, often in visible form, the Christians of his
own time.</p>
<p>These distinctions may seem over-subtle, but our meaning will surely
be plain to anyone who will compare &ldquo;The Fa&euml;rie Queen,&rdquo;
or the legend of St. George, with the Gnostic or Hindoo reveries, and
the fantastic and truly Eastern interpretation of Scripture, which the
European monks borrowed from Egypt.&nbsp; Our opinion is, that in the
old legends the moral did not create the story, but the story the moral;
and that the story had generally a nucleus of fact within all its distortions
and exaggerations.&nbsp; This holds good of the Odinic and Grecian myths;
all are now more or less inclined to believe that the deities of Zeus&rsquo;s
or Odin&rsquo;s dynasties were real conquerors or civilisers of flesh
and blood, like the Manco Capac of the Peruvians, and that it was around
records of their real victories over barbarous aborigines, and over
the brute powers of nature, that extravagant myths grew up, till more
civilised generations began to say: &ldquo;These tales must have some
meaning&mdash;they must be either allegories or nonsense;&rdquo; and
then fancied that in the remaining thread of fact they found a clue
to the mystic sense of the whole.</p>
<p>Such, we suspect, has been the history of St. George and the Dragon,
as well as of Apollo and the Python.&nbsp; It is very hard to have to
give up the dear old dragon who haunted our nursery dreams, especially
when there is no reason for it.&nbsp; We have no patience with antiquaries
who tell us that the dragons who guarded princesses were merely &ldquo;the
winding walls or moats of their castles.&rdquo;&nbsp; What use then,
pray, was there in the famous nether garment with which Regnar Lodbrog
(shaggy-trousers) choked the dragon who guarded his lady-love?&nbsp;
And Regnar was a real piece of flesh and blood, as King &AElig;lla and
our Saxon forefathers found to their cost; his awful death-dirge, and
the effect which it produced, are well known to historians.&nbsp; We
cannot give up Regnar&rsquo;s trousers, for we suspect the key to the
whole dragon-question is in the pocket of them.</p>
<p>Seriously, Why should not those dragons have been simply what the
Greek word dragon means&mdash;what the earliest romances, the Norse
myths, and the superstitions of the peasantry in many parts of England
to this day assert them to have been&mdash;&ldquo;mighty worms,&rdquo;
huge snakes?&nbsp; All will agree that the Python, the representative
in the old world of the Boa-constrictor of the new, lingered in the
Homeric age, if not later, both in Greece and in Italy.&nbsp; It existed
on the opposite coast of Africa (where it is now extinct) in the time
of Regulus; we believe, from the traditions of all nations, that it
existed to a far later date in more remote and barbarous parts of Europe.&nbsp;
There is every reason to suppose that it still lingered in England after
the invasion of the Cymri&mdash;say not earlier than B.C. 600&mdash;for
it was among them an object of worship; and we question whether they
would have been likely to have adored a foreign animal, and, as at Abury,
built enormous temples in imitation of its windings, and called them
by its name.</p>
<p>The only answer to these traditions has as yet been, that no reptile
of that bulk is known in cold climates.&nbsp; Yet the Python still lingers
in the Hungarian marshes.&nbsp; A few years ago a huge snake, as large
as the Pythons of Hindostan, spread havoc among the flocks and terror
among the peasantry.&nbsp; Had it been Ariosto&rsquo;s &ldquo;Orc,&rdquo;
an &agrave; priori argument from science would have had weight.&nbsp;
A marsupiate sea-monster is horribly unorthodox; and the dragon, too,
has doubtless been made a monster of, but most unjustly: his legs have
been patched on by crocodile-slaying crusaders, while his wings&mdash;where
did they come from?&nbsp; From the traditions of &ldquo;flying serpents,&rdquo;
which have so strangely haunted the deserts of Upper Egypt from the
time of the old Hebrew prophets, and which may not, after all, be such
lies as folk fancy.&nbsp; How scientific prigs shook with laughter at
the notion of a flying dragon! till one day geology revealed to them,
in the Pterodactylus, that a real flying dragon, on the model of Carlo
Crivelli&rsquo;s in Mrs. Jameson&rsquo;s book, with wings before and
legs behind, only more monstrous than that, and than all the dreams
of Seba and Aldrovandus (though some of theirs, to be sure, have seven
heads), got its living once on a time in this very island of England!&nbsp;
But such is the way of this wise world!&nbsp; When Le Vaillant, in the
last century, assured the Parisians that he had shot a giraffe at the
Cape, he was politely informed that the giraffe was fabulous, extinct&mdash;in
short, that he lied; and now, behold! the respectable old unicorn (and
good Tories ought to rejoice to hear it) has been discovered at last
by a German naturalist, Von M&uuml;ller, in Abyssinia, just where our
fathers told us to look for it!&nbsp; And why should we not find the
flying serpent too?&nbsp; The interior of Africa is as yet an unknown
world of wonders; and we may yet discover there, for aught we know,
the descendants of the very satyr who chatted with St. Anthony.</p>
<p>No doubt the discovery of huge fossil animals, as Mrs. Jameson says,
on the high authority of Professor Owen, may have modified our ancestors&rsquo;
notions of dragons: but in the old serpent worship we believe the real
explanation of these stories is to be found.&nbsp; There is no doubt
that human victims, and even young maidens, were offered to these snake-gods;
even the sunny mythology of Greece retains horrible traces of such customs,
which lingered in Arcadia, the mountain fastness of the old and conquered
race.&nbsp; Similar cruelties existed among the Mexicans; and there
are but too many traces of it throughout the history of heathendom.</p>
<p>The same superstition may, as the legends assert, have lingered on,
or been at least revived during the later ages of the empire, in remote
provinces, left in their primeval barbarism, at the same time that they
were brutalised by the fiendish exhibitions of the Circus, which the
Roman governors found it their interest to introduce everywhere.&nbsp;
Thus the serpent became naturally regarded as the manifestation of the
evil spirit by Christians as well as by the old Hebrews; thus, also,
it became the presiding genius of the malaria and fever which arose
from the fens haunted by it&mdash;a superstition which gave rise to
the theory that the tales of Hercules and the Hydra, Apollo and the
mud-Python, St. George and the Dragon, were sanitary-reform allegories,
and the monsters whose poisonous breath destroyed cattle and young maidens
only typhus and consumption.&nbsp; We see no reason why early Christian
heroes should not have actually met with such snake-gods, and felt themselves
bound, like Southey&rsquo;s Madoc, or Daniel in the old rabbinical story,
whose truth has never been disproved, to destroy the monsters at all
risk.&nbsp; We see no reason, either, why their righteous daring may
not have been crowned with victory; and suspect that on such events
were gradually built up the dragon-slaying legends which charmed all
Europe, and grew in extravagances and absurdities, till they began to
degenerate into the bombast of the &ldquo;Seven Champions,&rdquo; and
expired in the immortal ballad of the &ldquo;Dragon of Wantley,&rdquo;
in which More of More Hall, on the morning of his battle with the monster,
invoked the saints no more, but&mdash;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>To make him strong and mighty&mdash;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He drank
by the tale<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six pots of ale<br />And a quart
of aqua-vit&aelig;.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>So ended the sublime sport of dragon-slaying.&nbsp; Its only remnant
may now be seen in Borneo, whither that noble Christian man, Bishop
Macdougall, took out the other day a six-chambered rifle, on the ground
that &ldquo;while the alligators ate his school-children at Sarawak,
it was his duty as a bishop to shoot the alligators.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>ON ENGLISH COMPOSITION</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Introductory Lectures given at Queen&rsquo;s College, London, 1848.</p>
<p>An introductory lecture on English composition is, I think, as much
needed as one on any other subject taught in this College.&nbsp; For
in the first place, I am not sure whether we all mean the same thing
when we speak of English composition; and in the next place, I believe
that pupils themselves are very often best able to tell their teachers
what sort of instruction they require.&nbsp; I purpose therefore to-day,
not only to explain freely my intentions with regard to this course
of lectures, but to ask you to explain freely your own wants.</p>
<p>I must suppose, however, that the ladies who attend here wish to
be taught how to write English better.&nbsp; Now the art of writing
English is, I should say, the art of speaking English, and speech may
be used for any one of three purposes: to conceal thought, as the French
diplomatist defined its use; to conceal the want of thought, as the
majority of popular writers and orators seem nowadays to employ it;
or, again, to express thought, which would seem to have been the original
destination of the gift of language.&nbsp; I am therefore, I suppose,
in duty bound to take for granted that you come here to be taught to
express your thoughts better.</p>
<p>The whole matter then will very much depend on what thoughts you
have to express.&nbsp; For the form of the symbol must depend on the
form of the thing symbolised, as the medal does upon its die; and thus
style and language are the sacraments of thoughts, the outward and visible
signs of the inward and spiritual grace, or want of grace, in the writer.&nbsp;
And even where language is employed to conceal either thought, or want
thereof, it generally tells a truer tale than it was meant to do.&nbsp;
Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth must speak, and the hollowness
or foolishness of the spirit will show itself, in spite of all cunning
sleights, in unconscious peculiarities or defects of style.</p>
<p>Hence I say style, as the expression of thought, will depend entirely
on what there is within to be expressed, on the character of the writer&rsquo;s
mind and heart.&nbsp; We all allow this implicitly in the epithets which
we apply to different styles.&nbsp; We talk of a vigorous, a soft, a
weak, a frigid, an obscure style, not meaning that the words and sentences
in themselves are vigorous, soft, weak, or even obscure (for the words
and their arrangement may be simple enough all the while).&nbsp; No,
you speak of the quality of the thoughts conveyed in the words; that
a style is powerful, because the writer is feeling and thinking strongly
and clearly; weak or frigid, because his feelings on the subject have
been weak or cold; obscure to you, because his thoughts have been obscure
to himself&mdash;because, in short, he has not clearly imagined to himself
the notion which he wishes to embody.&nbsp; The meaning of the very
words &ldquo;expression&rdquo; and &ldquo;composition&rdquo; prove the
truth of my assertion.&nbsp; Expression is literally the pressing out
into palpable form that which is already within us, and composition,
in the same way, is the composing or putting together of materials already
existing&mdash;the form and method of the composition depend mainly
on the form and quality of the materials.&nbsp; You cannot compose a
rope of sand, or a round globe of square stones&mdash;and my friend
Mr. Strettell will tell you, in his lectures on grammar, that words
are just as stubborn and intractable materials as sand or stone, and
that we cannot alter their meaning or value a single shade, for they
derive that meaning from a higher fountain than the soul of man, from
the Word of God, the fount of utterance, who inspires all true and noble
thought and speech&mdash;who vindicated language as His own gift, and
man&rsquo;s invention, in that miracle of the day of Pentecost.&nbsp;
And I am bound to follow up Mr. Strettell&rsquo;s teaching by telling
you that what holds true of words, and of their grammatic and logical
composition, holds true also of their &aelig;sthetic and artistic composition,
of style, of rhythm, of poetry, and oratory.&nbsp; Every principle of
these which is true and good, that is, which produces beauty, is to
be taken as an inspiration from above, as depending not on the will
of man but of God; not on any abstract rules, of pedant&rsquo;s invention,
but on the eternal necessities and harmony, on the being of God Himself.</p>
<p>These may seem lofty words, but I do not think they are likely to
make us lofty-minded.&nbsp; I think that the belief of them will tend
to make us all more reverent and earnest in examining the utterances
of others, more simple and truthful in giving vent to our own, fearing
equally all prejudiced and hasty criticism, all self-willed mannerism,
all display of fine words, as sins against the divine dignity of language.&nbsp;
From these assertions I think we may conclude what is the true method
of studying style.&nbsp; The critical examination of good authors, looking
at language as an inspiration, and its laws as things independent of
us, eternal and divine, we must search into them as we would into any
other set of facts, in nature, or the Bible, by patient induction.&nbsp;
We must not be content with any traditional maxims, or abstract rules,
such as have been put forth in Blair and Lord Kaimes, for these are
merely worked out by the head, and can give us no insight into the magic
which touches the heart.&nbsp; All abstract rules of criticism, indeed,
are very barren.&nbsp; We may read whole folios of them without getting
one step farther than we were at first, viz. that what is beautiful
is beautiful.&nbsp; Indeed, these abstract rules generally tend to narrow
our notions of what is beautiful, in their attempt to explain spiritual
things by the carnal understanding.&nbsp; All they do is to explain
them away, and so those who depend on them are tempted to deny the beauty
of every thing which cannot be thus analysed and explained away, according
to the established rule and method.&nbsp; I shall have to point out
this again to you, when we come to speak of the Pope and Johnson school
of critics, and the way in which they wrote whole folios on Shakespeare,
without ever penetrating a single step deeper towards the secret of
his sublimity.&nbsp; It was just this idolatry of abstract rules which
made Johnson call Bishop Percy&rsquo;s invaluable collection of ancient
ballads &ldquo;stuff and nonsense.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was this which made
Voltaire talk of &ldquo;Hamlet&rdquo; as the ravings of a drunken savage,
because forsooth it could not be crammed into the artificial rules of
French tragedy.&nbsp; It is this which, even at this day, makes some
men of highly-cultivated taste declare that they can see no poetry in
the writings of Mr. Tennyson; the cause, little as they are aware of
it, simply being that neither his excellences nor his faults are after
the model of the Etonian classical school which reigned in England fifty
years ago.&nbsp; When these critics speak of that with which they sympathise
they are admirable.&nbsp; They become childish only when they resolve
to bind all by maxims which may suit themselves.</p>
<p>We must then, I think, absolutely eschew any abstract rules as starting-points.&nbsp;
What rules we may require, we must neither borrow nor invent, but discover,
during the course of our reading.&nbsp; We must take passages whose
power and beauty is universally acknowledged, and try by reverently
and patiently dissecting them to see into the secret of their charm,
to see why and how they are the best possible expressions of the author&rsquo;s
mind.&nbsp; Then for the wider laws of art, we may proceed to examine
whole works, single elegies, essays, and dramas.</p>
<p>In carrying out all this, it will be safest, as always, to follow
the course of nature, and begin where God begins with us.&nbsp; For
as every one of us is truly a microcosm, a whole miniature world within
ourselves, so is the history of each individual more or less the history
of the whole human race, and there are few of us but pass through the
same course of intellectual growth, through which the whole English
nation has passed, with an exactness and perfection proportionate, of
course, to the richness and vigour of each person&rsquo;s character.&nbsp;
Now as in the nation, so in the individual, poetry springs up before
prose.&nbsp; Look at the history of English literature, how completely
it is the history of our own childhood and adolescence, in its successive
fashions.&nbsp; First, fairy tales&mdash;then ballads of adventure,
love, and war&mdash;then a new tinge of foreign thought and feeling,
generally French, as it was with the English nation in the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries&mdash;then elegiac and reflective poetry&mdash;then
classic art begins to influence our ripening youth, as it did the youth
of our nation in the sixteenth century, and delight in dramatic poetry
follows as a natural consequence&mdash;and last, but not least, as the
fruit of all these changes, a vigorous and matured prose.&nbsp; For
indeed, as elocution is the highest melody, so is true prose the highest
poetry.&nbsp; Consider how in an air, the melody is limited to a few
arbitrary notes, and recurs at arbitrary periods, while the more scientific
the melody becomes, the more numerous and nearly allied are the notes
employed, and the more complex and uncertain is their recurrence&mdash;in
short, the nearer does the melody of the air approach to the melody
of elocution, in which the notes of the voice ought continually to be
passing into each other, by imperceptible gradations, and their recurrence
to depend entirely on the emotions conveyed in the subject words.&nbsp;
Just so, poetry employs a confined and arbitrary metre, and a periodic
recurrence of sounds which disappear gradually in its higher forms of
the ode and the drama, till the poetry at last passes into prose, a
free and ever-shifting flow of every imaginable rhythm and metre, determined
by no arbitrary rules, but only by the spiritual intent of the subject.&nbsp;
The same will hold good of whole prose compositions, when compared with
whole poems.</p>
<p>Prose then is highest.&nbsp; To write a perfect prose must be your
ultimate object in attending these lectures; but we must walk before
we can run, and walk with leading-strings before we can walk alone,
and such leading-strings are verse and rhyme.&nbsp; Some tradition of
this is still kept up in the practice of making boys write Latin and
Greek verses at school, which is of real service to the intellect, even
when most carelessly employed, and which, when earnestly carried out,
is one great cause of the public school and University man&rsquo;s superiority
in style to most self-educated authors.&nbsp; And why should women&rsquo;s
writings be in any respect inferior to that of men, if they are only
willing to follow out the same method of self-education?</p>
<p>Do not fancy, when I say that we must learn poetry before we learn
prose, that I am only advancing a paradox; mere talking is no more prose
than mere rhyme is poetry.&nbsp; Monsieur Jourdain, in Moli&egrave;re&rsquo;s
comedy, makes, I suspect, a very great mistake, when he tells his master:
&ldquo;If that means prose, I&rsquo;ve been talking prose all my life.&rdquo;&nbsp;
I fancy the good man had been no more talking prose, than an awkward
country boy has been really walking all his life, because he has been
contriving somehow to put one leg before the other.&nbsp; To see what
walking is, we must look at the perfectly-drilled soldier, or at the
perfectly-accomplished lady, who has been taught to dance in order that
she may know how to walk.&nbsp; Dancing has been well called the poetry
of motion; but the tender grace, the easy dignity in every gesture of
daily life which the perfect dancer exhibits answers exactly to that
highly-organised prose which ought to be the offspring of a critical
acquaintance with poetry.&nbsp; Milton&rsquo;s matchless prose style,
for instance, grows naturally from his matchless power over rhyme and
metre.&nbsp; Practice in versification might be unnecessary if we were
all born world-geniuses; so would practice in dancing, if every lady
had the figure of a Venus and the garden of Eden for a playground.&nbsp;
But even the ancient Greeks amid every advantage of climate, dress,
and physical beauty, considered a thorough instruction in all athletic
and graceful exercises as indispensably necessary, not only to a boy&rsquo;s
but also to a girl&rsquo;s education, and in like manner, I think the
exquisite models of prose with which English literature abounds will
not supersede the necessity of a careful training in versification,
nay, will rather make such a training all the more requisite for those
who wish to imitate such excellence.&nbsp; Pray understand me: by using
the word &ldquo;imitate,&rdquo; I do not mean that I wish you to ape
the style of any favourite author.&nbsp; Your aim will not be to write
like this man or that woman, but to write like yourselves, being of
course responsible for what yourselves are like.&nbsp; Do not be afraid
to let the peculiarities of your different characters show yourselves
in your styles.&nbsp; Your prose may be the rougher for it, but it will
be at least honest; and all mannerism is dishonesty, an attempt to gain
beauty at the expense of truthful expression which invariably defeats
its own ends, and produces an unpleasing effect, so necessarily one
are truth and beauty.&nbsp; So far then from wishing to foster in you
any artificial mannerism, mannerism is that foul enchanter from whom,
above all others, I am sworn &ldquo;en preux chevalier&rdquo; to deliver
you.&nbsp; As Professor Maurice warned me when I undertook this lectureship,
my object in teaching you about &ldquo;styles&rdquo; should be that
you may have no style at all.&nbsp; But mannerism can be only avoided
by the most thorough practice and knowledge.&nbsp; Half-educated writers
are always mannerists; while, as the ancient canon says, &ldquo;the
perfection of art is to conceal art&rdquo;&mdash;to depart from uncultivated
and therefore defective nature, to rise again through art to a more
organised and therefore more simple naturalness.&nbsp; Just as, to carry
on the analogy which I employed just now, it is only the perfect dancer
who arrives at that height of art at which her movements seem dictated
not by conscious science, but unconscious nature.</p>
<p>I do hope then that the study, and still more the practice of versification,
may produce in you the same good effects which they do in young men;
that they may give you a habit of portioning out your thoughts distinctly
and authentically in a more simple, condensed, and expressive style;
that they may teach you what elevation of language, what class of sounds,
what flow of words may best suit your tone of thought and feeling, that
they may prevent in you that tendency to monotonous repetition, and
vain wordiness, which is the bosom sin of most uneducated prose writers,
not only of the ladies of the nineteenth century, but of the Middle
Age monks, who, having in general no poetry on which to form their taste,
except the effeminate and bombastic productions of the dying Roman empire,
fell into a certain washy prolixity, which has made monk Latin a byword,
and puts one sadly in mind of what is too truly called &ldquo;young
ladies&rsquo; English.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I should like then to begin with two or three of the early ballads,
and carefully analyse them with you.&nbsp; I am convinced that in them
we may discover many of the great primary laws of composition, as well
as the secrets of sublimity and pathos in their very simplest manifestations.&nbsp;
It may be that there are some here to whom the study of old ballads
may be a little distasteful, who are in an age when the only poetry
which has charms is the subjective and self-conscious &ldquo;poetry
of the heart&rdquo;&mdash;to whom a stanza of &ldquo;Childe Harolde&rdquo;
may seem worth all the ballads that ever were written: but let me remind
them that woman is by her sex an educator, that every one here must
expect, ay hope, to be employed at some time or other in training the
minds of children; then let me ask them to recall the years in which
objective poems, those which dealt with events, ballads, fairy tales,
down to nursery rhymes, were their favourite intellectual food, and
let me ask them whether it will not be worth while, for the sake of
the children whom they may hereafter influence, to bestow a little thought
on this earlier form of verse.</p>
<p>I must add too, that without some understanding of these same ballads,
we shall never arrive at a critical appreciation of Shakespeare.&nbsp;
For the English drama springs from an intermarriage between this same
ballad poetry, the poetry of incidents, and that subjective elegiac
poetry which deals with the feelings and consciousnesses of man.&nbsp;
They are the two poles, by whose union our drama is formed, and some
critical knowledge of both of them will be, as I said, necessary before
we can study it.</p>
<p>After the ballads, we ought, I think, to know a little about the
early Norman poetry, whose fusion with the pure north Saxon ballad school
produced Chaucer and the poets previous to the Reformation.&nbsp; We
shall proceed to Chaucer himself; then to the rise of the drama; then
to the poets of the Elizabethan age.&nbsp; I shall analyse a few of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s masterpieces; then speak of Milton and Spenser;
thence pass to the prose of Sidney, Hooker, Bacon, Taylor, and our later
great authors.&nbsp; Thus our Composition lectures will follow an historical
method, parallel with, and I hope illustrative of, the lectures on English
History.</p>
<p>But it will not be enough, I am afraid, to study the style of others
without attempting something yourselves.&nbsp; No criticism teaches
so much as the criticism of our own works.&nbsp; And I hope therefore
that you will not think that I ask too much of you when I propose that
weekly prose and verse compositions, on set subjects, be sent in by
the class.&nbsp; To the examination of these the latter half of each
lecture may be devoted, and the first half-hour to the study of various
authors: and in order that I may be able to speak my mind freely on
them I should propose that they be anonymous.&nbsp; I hope that you
will all trust me when I tell you that those who have themselves experienced
what labour attends the task of composition, are generally most tender
and charitable in judging of the work of others, and that whatever remarks
I may make will be such only as a man has a right to make on a woman&rsquo;s
composition.</p>
<p>And if I may seem to be asking anything new or troublesome, I beg
you to remember, that it is the primary idea of this College to vindicate
women&rsquo;s right to an education in all points equal to that of men;
the difference between them being determined not by any fancied inferiority
of mind, but simply by the distinct offices and character of the sexes.&nbsp;
And surely when you recollect the long drudgery at Greek and Latin verses
which is required of every highly-educated man, and the high importance
which has attached to them for centuries in the opinion of Englishmen,
you cannot think that I am too <i>exigeant</i> in asking you for a few
sets of English verses.&nbsp; Believe me, that you ought to find their
beneficial effect in producing, as I said before, a measured deliberate
style of expression, a habit of calling up clear and distinct images
on all subjects, a power of condensing and arranging your thoughts,
such as no practice in prose themes can ever give.&nbsp; If you are
disappointed of these results it will not be the fault of this long-proved
method of teaching, but of my own inability to carry it out.&nbsp; Indeed
I cannot too strongly confess my own ignorance or fear my own inability.&nbsp;
I stand aghast when I compare my means and my idea, but I believe that
&ldquo;by teaching thou shalt learn,&rdquo; is a rule of which I too
shall take the benefit, and having begun these lectures in the name
of Him who is The Word, and with the firm intention of asserting throughout
His claims as the inspirer of all language and of all art, I may perhaps
hope for the fulfilment of His own promise: &ldquo;Be not anxious what
you shall speak, for it shall be given you in that day and in that hour
what you shall speak.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>ON ENGLISH LITERATURE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Introductory Lecture given at Queen&rsquo;s College, London, 1848.</p>
<p>An introductory lecture must, I suppose, be considered as a sort
of art-exhibition, or advertisement of the wares hereafter to be furnished
by the lecturer.&nbsp; If these, on actual use, should prove to fall
far short of the promise conveyed in the programme, hearers must remember
that the lecturer is bound, even to his own shame, to set forth in all
commencements the most perfect method of teaching which he can devise,
in order that human frailty may have something at which to aim; at the
same time begging all to consider that in this piecemeal world, it is
sufficient not so much to have realised one&rsquo;s ideal, as earnestly
to have tried to realise it, according to the measure of each man&rsquo;s
gifts.&nbsp; Besides, what may not be fulfilled in a first course, or
in a first generation of teachers, may still be effected by those who
follow them.&nbsp; It is but fair to expect that if this Institution
shall prove, as I pray God it may, a centre of female education worthy
of the wants of the coming age, the method and the practice of the College
will be developing, as years bring experience and wider eye-range, till
we become truly able to teach the English woman of the nineteenth century
to bear her part in an era, which, as I believe, more and more bids
fair to eclipse, in faith and in art, in science and in polity, any
and every period of glory which Christendom has yet beheld.</p>
<p>The first requisite, I think, for a modern course of English Literature
is, that it be a whole course or none.&nbsp; The literary education
of woman has too often fallen into the fault of our &ldquo;Elegant Extracts,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Beauties of British Poetry.&rdquo;&nbsp; It has neither begun
at the beginning nor ended at the end.&nbsp; The young have been taught
to admire the laurels of Parnassus, but only after they have been clipped
and pollarded like a Dutch shrubbery.&nbsp; The roots which connect
them with mythic antiquity, and the fresh leaves and flowers of the
growing present, have been generally cut off with care, and the middle
part only has been allowed to be used&mdash;too often, of course, a
sufficiently tough and dry stem.&nbsp; This method is no doubt easy,
because it saves teachers the trouble of investigating antiquity, and
saves them too the still more delicate task of judging contemporaneous
authors&mdash;but like all half measures, it has bred less good than
evil.&nbsp; If we could silence a free press, and the very free tongues
of modern society; if we could clip the busy, imaginative, craving mind
of youth on the Procrustean bed of use and wont, the method might succeed;
but we can do neither&mdash;the young <i>will</i> read and <i>will</i>
hear; and the consequence is, a general complaint that the minds of
young women are outgrowing their mothers&rsquo; guidance, that they
are reading books which their mothers never dreamt of reading, of many
of which they never heard, many at least whose good and evil they have
had no means of investigating; that the authors which really interest
and influence the minds of the young are just the ones which have formed
no part of their education, and therefore those for judging of which
they have received no adequate rules; that, in short, in literature
as in many things, education in England is far behind the wants of the
age.</p>
<p>Now this is all wrong and ruinous.&nbsp; The mother&rsquo;s mind
should be the lodestar of the daughter&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Anything which
loosens the bond of filial reverence, of filial resignation, is even
more destructive, if possible, to womanhood than to manhood&mdash;the
certain bane of both.&nbsp; And the evil fruits are evident enough&mdash;self-will
and self-conceit in the less gentle, restlessness and dissatisfaction
in many of the meekest and gentlest; talents seem with most a curse
instead of a blessing; clever and earnest young women, like young men,
are beginning to wander up and down in all sorts of eclecticisms and
dilettanteisms&mdash;one year they find out that the dark ages were
not altogether barbarous, and by a revulsion of feeling natural to youth,
they begin to adore them as a very galaxy of light, beauty, and holiness.&nbsp;
Then they begin to crave naturally enough for some real understanding
of this strange ever-developing nineteenth century, some real sympathy
with its new wonders, some real sphere of labour in it; and this drives
them to devour the very newest authors&mdash;any book whatever which
seems to open for them the riddle of the mighty and mysterious present,
which is forcing itself on their attention through every sense.&nbsp;
And so up and down, amid confusions and oscillations from pole to pole,
and equally eclectic at either pole, from St. Augustin and Mr. Pugin
to Goethe and George Sand, and all intensified and coloured by that
tender enthusiasm, that craving for something to worship, which is a
woman&rsquo;s highest grace, or her bitterest curse&mdash;wander these
poor Noah&rsquo;s doves, without either ark of shelter or rest for the
sole of their foot, sometimes, alas! over strange ocean-wastes, into
gulfs of error&mdash;too sad to speak of here&mdash;and <i>will</i>
wander more and more till teachers begin boldly to face reality, and
interpret to them both the old and the new, lest they misinterpret them
for themselves.&nbsp; The educators of the present generation must meet
the cravings of the young spirit with the bread of life, or they will
gorge themselves with poison.&nbsp; Telling them that they ought not
to be hungry, will not stop their hunger; shutting our eyes to facts,
will only make us stumble over them the sooner; hiding our eyes in the
sand, like the hunted ostrich, will not hide us from the iron necessity
of circumstances, or from the Almighty will of Him, who is saying in
these days to society, in language unmistakable: &ldquo;Educate, or
fall to pieces!&nbsp; Speak the <i>whole</i> truth to the young, or
take the consequences of your cowardice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On these grounds I should wish to see established in this College
a really entire course of English Literature, such as shall give correct,
reverent, and loving views of every period, from the earliest legends
and poetry of the Middle Age, up to the latest of our modern authors,
and in the case of the higher classes, if it should hereafter be found
practicable, lectures devoted to the criticism of such authors as may
be exercising any real influence upon the minds of English women.&nbsp;
This, I think, should be our ideal.&nbsp; It must be attempted cautiously
and step by step.&nbsp; It will not be attained at the first trial,
certainly not by the first lecturer.&nbsp; Sufficient, if each succeeding
teacher shall leave something more taught, some fresh extension of the
range of knowledge which is thought fit for his scholars.</p>
<p>I said that the ages of history were analogous to the ages of man,
and that each age of literature was the truest picture of the history
of its day; and for this very reason English literature is the best
perhaps, the only teacher of English history, to women especially.&nbsp;
For it seems to me that it is principally by the help of such an extended
literary course, that we can cultivate a just and enlarged taste, which
will connect education with the deepest feelings of the heart.&nbsp;
It seems hardly fair, or reasonable either, to confine the reading of
the young to any certain fancied Augustan age of authors, I mean those
of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries; especially when that age
requires, in order to appreciate it, a far more developed mind, a far
greater experience of mankind and of the world, than falls to the lot
of one young woman out of a thousand.&nbsp; Strong meat for men, and
milk for babes.&nbsp; But why are we to force on any age spiritual food
unfitted for it?&nbsp; If we do we shall be likely only to engender
a lasting disgust for that by which our pupils might have fully profited,
had they only been introduced to it when they were ready for it.&nbsp;
And this actually happens with English literature: by having the so-called
standard works thrust upon them too early, and then only in a fragmentary
form, not fresh and whole, but cut up into the very driest hay, the
young too often neglect in after-life the very books which then might
become the guides of their taste.&nbsp; Hence proceed in the minds of
the young sudden and irregular revulsions of affection for different
schools of writing: and all revolutions in the individual as well as
in the nation are sure to be accompanied by some dead loss of what has
been already gained, some disruption of feelings, some renunciation
of principles, which ought to have been preserved; something which might
have borne fruit is sure to be crushed in the earthquake.&nbsp; Many
before me must surely have felt this.&nbsp; Do none here remember how,
when they first escaped from the dry class-drudgery of Pope and Johnson,
they snatched greedily at the forbidden fruit of Byron, perhaps of Shelley,
and sentimental novel-writers innumerable?&nbsp; How when the luscious
melancholy of their morbid self-consciousness began to pall on the appetite,
they fled for refuge as suddenly to mere poetry of description and action,
to Southey, Scott, the ballad-literature of all ages?&nbsp; How when
the craving returned (perhaps unconsciously to themselves) to understand
the wondrous heart of man, they tried to satisfy it with deep draughts
of Wordsworth&rsquo;s celestial and pure simplicity?&nbsp; How again,
they tired of that too gentle and unworldly strain, and sought in Shakespeare
something more exciting, more genial, more rich in the facts and passions
of daily life?&nbsp; How even his all-embracing genius failed to satisfy
them, because he did not palpably connect for them their fancy and their
passions with their religious faith&mdash;and so they wandered out again
over the sea of literature, heaven only knows whither, in search of
a school of authors yet, alas! unborn.&nbsp; For the true literature
of the nineteenth century, the literature which shall set forth in worthy
strains the relation of the two greatest facts, namely, of the universe
and of Christ, which shall transfigure all our enlarged knowledge of
science and of society, of nature, of art, and man, with the eternal
truths of the gospel, that poetry of the future is not yet here: but
it is coming, ay even at the doors, when this great era shall become
conscious of its high vocation, and the author too shall claim his priestly
calling, and the poets of the world, like the kingdoms of the world,
shall become the poets of God and of His Christ.</p>
<p>But to return.&nbsp; Should we not rather in education follow that
method which Providence has already mapped out for us?&nbsp; If we are
bound, as of course we are, to teach our pupils to breathe freely on
the highest mountain-peaks of Shakespeare&rsquo;s art, how can we more
certainly train them to do so, than by leading them along the same upward
path by which Shakespeare himself rose&mdash;through the various changes
of taste, the gradual developments of literature, through which the
English mind had been passing before Shakespeare&rsquo;s time?&nbsp;
For there was a literature before Shakespeare.&nbsp; Had there not been,
neither would there have been a Shakespeare.&nbsp; Critics are now beginning
to see that the old fancy which made Shakespeare spring up at once,
a self-perfected poet, like Minerva full-armed from the head of Jove,
was a superstition of pedants, who neither knew the ages before the
great poet, nor the man himself, except that little of him which seemed
to square with their shallow mechanical taste.&nbsp; The old fairy superstition,
the old legends and ballads, the old chronicles of feudal war and chivalry,
the earlier moralities and mysteries, and tragi-comic attempts&mdash;these
were the roots of his poetic tree&mdash;they must be the roots of any
literary education which can teach us to appreciate him.&nbsp; These
fed Shakespeare&rsquo;s youth; why should they not feed our children&rsquo;s?&nbsp;
Why indeed?&nbsp; That inborn delight of the young in all that is marvellous
and fantastic&mdash;has that a merely evil root?&nbsp; No surely!&nbsp;
It is a most pure part of their spiritual nature; a part of &ldquo;the
heaven which lies about us in our infancy;&rdquo; angel-wings with which
the free child leaps the prison-walls of sense and custom, and the drudgery
of earthly life&mdash;like the wild dreams of childhood, it is a God-appointed
means for keeping alive what noble Wordsworth calls</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those obstinate questionings<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of
sense and outward things,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fallings from us, vanishings;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blank
misgivings of a creature<br />Moving about in worlds not realised;</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p>by which</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though inland far we be,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
souls have sight of that immortal sea<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which brought
us hither:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can in a moment travel thither,<br />And
see the children sporting on the shore,<br />And hear the mighty waters
rolling evermore.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>And those old dreams of our ancestors in the childhood of England,
they are fantastic enough, no doubt, and unreal, but yet they are most
true and most practical, if we but use them as parables and symbols
of human feeling and everlasting truth.&nbsp; What, after all, is any
event of earth, palpable as it may seem, but, like them, a shadow and
a ghostly dream, till it has touched our <i>hearts</i>, till we have
found out and obeyed its spiritual lesson?&nbsp; Be sure that one really
pure legend or ballad may bring God&rsquo;s truth and heaven&rsquo;s
beauty more directly home to the young spirit than whole volumes of
dry abstract didactic morality.&nbsp; Outward things, beauty, action,
nature, are the great problems for the young.&nbsp; God has put them
in a visible world, that by what they <i>see</i> they may learn to know
the <i>unseen</i>; and we must begin to feed their minds with that literature
which deals most with visible things, with passion manifested in action,
which we shall find in the early writing of our Middle Ages; for then
the collective mind of our nation was passing through its natural stages
of childhood and budding youth, as every nation and every single individual
must at some time or other do; a true &ldquo;young England,&rdquo; always
significant and precious to the young.&nbsp; I said there was a literary
art before Shakespeare&mdash;an art more simple, more childlike, more
girlish as it were, and therefore all the more adapted for young minds.&nbsp;
But also an art most vigorous and pure in point of style: thoroughly
fitted to give its readers the first elements of taste, which must lie
at the root of even the most complex &aelig;sthetics.&nbsp; I know no
higher specimens of poetic style, considering the subject, and the belief
of the time about them, than may be found in many of our old ballads.&nbsp;
How many poets are there in England now, who could have written &ldquo;The
Twa Bairns,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Sir Patrick Spens?&rdquo;&nbsp; How many
such histories as old William of Malmesbury, in spite of all his foolish
monk miracles?&nbsp; As few now as there were then; and as for lying
legends&mdash;they had their superstitions, and we have ours; and the
next generation will stare at our strange doings as much as we stare
at our forefathers.&nbsp; For our forefathers they were; we owe them
filial reverence, thoughtful attention, and more&mdash;we must know
them ere we can know ourselves.&nbsp; The only key to the present is
the <i>past.</i></p>
<p>But I must go farther still, and after premising that the English
classics, so called, of the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries will
of course form the bulk of the lectures, I must plead for some instruction
in the works of recent and living authors.&nbsp; I cannot see why we
are to teach the young about the past and not about the present.&nbsp;
After all, they have to live now, and at no other time; in this same
nineteenth century lies their work: it may be unfortunate, but we cannot
help it.&nbsp; I do not see why we should wish to help it.&nbsp; I know
no century which the world has yet seen so well worth living in.&nbsp;
Let us thank God that we are here now, and joyfully try to understand
<i>where</i> we are, and what our work is <i>here</i>.&nbsp; As for
all superstitions about &ldquo;the good old times,&rdquo; and fancies
that <i>they</i> belonged to God, while this age belongs only to man,
blind chance, and the Evil One, let us cast them from us as the suggestions
of an evil lying spirit, as the natural parents of laziness, pedantry,
popery, and unbelief.&nbsp; And therefore let us not fear to tell our
children the meaning of this present day, and of all its different voices.&nbsp;
Let us not be content to say to them, as we have been doing: &ldquo;We
will see you well instructed in the past, but you must make out the
present for yourselves.&rdquo;&nbsp; Why, if the past is worth explaining,
far more is the present&mdash;the pressing, noisy, complex present,
where our work-field lies, the most intricate of all states of society,
and of all schools of literature yet known, and therefore the very one
requiring most explanation.</p>
<p>How rich in strange and touching utterances have been the last fifty
years of English literature.&nbsp; Do you think that God has been teaching
us nothing in them?&nbsp; Will He not <i>make</i> our children listen
to that teaching, whether we like or not?&nbsp; And suppose our most
modern writers <i>had</i> added nothing to the stock of national knowledge,
which I most fervently deny, yet are they not actually influencing the
minds of the young? and can we prevent their doing so either directly
or indirectly?&nbsp; If we do not find them right teaching about their
own day, will they not be sure to find self-chosen teachers about it
themselves, who will be almost certainly the first who may come to hand,
and therefore as likely as not to be <i>bad</i> teachers?&nbsp; And
do we not see every day that it is just the most tender, the most enthusiastic,
the most precious spirits, who are most likely to be misled, because
their honest disgust at the follies of the day has most utterly outgrown
their critical training?&nbsp; And that lazy wholesale disapprobation
of living writers, so common and convenient, what does it do but injure
all reverence for parents and teachers, when the young find out that
the poet, who, as they were told, was a bungler and a charlatan, somehow
continues to touch the purest and noblest nerves of their souls, and
that the author who was said to be dangerous and unchristian, somehow
makes them more dutiful, more earnest, more industrious, more loving
to the poor?&nbsp; I speak of actual cases.&nbsp; Would to God they
were not daily ones!</p>
<p>Is it not then the wiser, because the more simple and trustful method,
both to God and our children, to say: &ldquo;You shall read living authors,
and we will teach you how to read them; you, like every child that is
born into the world, must eat the fruit of the tree of knowledge of
good and evil; we will see that you have your senses exercised to discern
between that good and that evil.&nbsp; You shall have the writers for
whom you long, as far as consists with common prudence and morality,
and more, you shall be taught them: all we ask of you is to be patient
and humble; believe us, you will never really appreciate these writers,
you will not even rationally enjoy their beauties, unless you submit
to a course of intellectual training like that through which most of
them have passed, and through which certainly this nation which produced
them has passed, in the successive stages of its growth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The best method, I think, of working out these principles would be
to devote a few lectures in the last term of every complete course,
to the examination of some select works of recent writers, chosen under
the sanction of the Educational Committee.&nbsp; But I must plead for
<i>whole</i> works.&nbsp; &ldquo;Extracts&rdquo; and &ldquo;Select Beauties&rdquo;
are about as practical as the worthy in the old story, who, wishing
to sell his house, brought one of the bricks to market as a specimen.&nbsp;
It is equally unfair on the author and on the pupil; for it is impossible
to show the merits or demerits of a work of art, even to explain the
truth or falsehood of any particular passage, except by viewing the
book as an organic whole.&nbsp; And as for the fear of raising a desire
to read more of an author than may be proper&mdash;when a work has once
been pointed out as really hurtful, the rest must be left to the best
safeguard which I have yet discovered, in man or woman&mdash;the pupil&rsquo;s
own honour.</p>
<p>Such a knowledge of English literature would tend no less, I think,
to the spread of healthy historic views among us.&nbsp; The literature
of every nation is its autobiography.&nbsp; Even in its most complex
and artistic forms, it is still a wonderfully artless and unconscious
record of its doubts and its faith, its sorrows and its triumphs, at
each era of its existence.&nbsp; Wonderfully artless and correct&mdash;because
all utterances which were not faithful to their time, which did not
touch some sympathetic chord in their heart&rsquo;s souls, are pretty
sure to have been swept out into wholesome oblivion, and only the most
genuine and earnest left behind for posterity.&nbsp; The history of
England indeed is the literature of England&mdash;but one very different
from any school history or other now in vogue.&nbsp; You will find it
neither a mere list of acts of parliament and record-office, like some;
nor yet an antiquarian gallery of costumes and armour, like others;
nor a mere war-gazette and report of killed and wounded from time to
time; least of all not a &ldquo;Debrett&rsquo;s Peerage,&rdquo; and
catalogue of kings and queens (whose names are given, while their souls
are ignored), but a true spiritual history of England&mdash;a picture
of the spirits of our old forefathers, who worked, and fought, and sorrowed,
and died for us; on whose accumulated labours we now here stand.&nbsp;
<i>That</i> I call a history&mdash;not of one class of offices or events,
but of the living human souls of English men and English women.&nbsp;
And therefore one most adapted to the mind of woman; one which will
call into fullest exercise her blessed faculty of sympathy, that pure
and tender heart of flesh, which teaches her always to find her highest
interest in mankind, simply as mankind; to see the Divine most completely
in the human; to prefer the incarnate to the disembodied, the personal
to the abstract, the pathetic to the intellectual; to see, and truly,
in the most common tale of village love or sorrow, a mystery deeper
and more divine than lies in all the theories of politicians or the
fixed ideas of the sage.</p>
<p>Such a course of history would quicken women&rsquo;s inborn <i>personal
interest</i> in the actors of this life-drama, and be quickened by it
in return, as indeed it ought: for it is thus that God intended woman
to look instinctively at the world.&nbsp; Would to God that she would
teach us men to look at it thus likewise!&nbsp; Would to God that she
would in these days claim and fulfil to the uttermost her vocation as
the priestess of charity!&mdash;that woman&rsquo;s heart would help
to deliver man from bondage to his own tyrannous and all-too-exclusive
brain&mdash;from our idolatry of mere dead laws and printed books&mdash;from
our daily sin of looking at men, not as our struggling and suffering
brothers, but as mere symbols of certain formul&aelig;), incarnations
of sets of opinions, wheels in some iron liberty-grinding or Christianity-spinning
machine, which we miscall society, or civilisation, or, worst misnomer
of all, the Church!</p>
<p>This I take to be one of the highest aims of woman&mdash;to preach
charity, love, and brotherhood: but in this nineteenth century, hunting
everywhere for law and organisation, refusing loyalty to anything which
cannot range itself under its theories, she will never get a hearing,
till her knowledge of the past becomes more organised and methodic.&nbsp;
As it is now, for want of large many-sided views of the past, her admiration
is too apt to attach itself to some two or three characters only in
the hero-list of all the ages.&nbsp; Then comes the temptation to thrust
aside all which interferes with her favourite idols, and so the very
heart given her for universal sympathy becomes the organ of an exclusive
bigotry, and she who should have taught man to love, too often only
embitters his hate.&nbsp; I claim, therefore, as necessary for the education
of the future, that woman should be initiated into the thoughts and
feelings of her countrymen in every age, from the wildest legends of
the past to the most palpable naturalism of the present; and that not
merely in a chronological order, sometimes not in chronological order
at all; but in a true spiritual sequence; that knowing the hearts of
many, she may in after life be able to comfort the hearts of all.</p>
<p>But there is yet another advantage in an extended study of English
literature&mdash;I mean the more national tone which it ought to give
the thoughts of the rising generation.&nbsp; Of course to repress the
reading of foreign books, to strive after any national exclusiveness,
or mere John-Bullism of mind, in an age of railroads and free press,
would be simply absurd&mdash;and more, it would be fighting against
the will of God revealed in events.&nbsp; He has put the literary treasures
of the Continent into our hands; we must joyfully accept them, and earnestly
exhaust them.&nbsp; This age is craving for what it calls catholicity;
for more complete interchange and brotherhood of thought between all
the nations of the earth.&nbsp; This spirit is stirring in the young
especially, and I believe that God Himself has inspired it, because
I see that He has first revealed the means of gratifying the desire,
at that very time in which it has arisen.</p>
<p>But every observant person must be aware that this tendency has produced
its evils as well as its good.&nbsp; There is a general complaint that
the minds of young women are becoming un-English; that their foreign
reading does not merely supply the deficiencies of their English studies,
but too often completely supersedes them; that the whole tone of their
thoughts is too often taken from French or German writings; that by
some means or other, the standard works of English literature are becoming
very much undervalued and neglected by the young people of this day;
and that self-will and irregular eclecticism are the natural results.</p>
<p>I must say that I consider the greater part of these evils as the
natural consequence of past mis-education; as the just punishment of
the old system, which attached the most disproportionate importance
to mere acquirements, and those mostly of foreign languages, foreign
music, and so forth, while the &ldquo;well of English undefiled,&rdquo;
and not only that, but English literature, history, patriotism, too
often English religion, have been made quite minor considerations.&nbsp;
Therefore so few of the young have any healthy and firm English standard
whereby to try and judge foreign thought.&nbsp; Therefore they fancy,
when they meet with anything deep and attractive in foreign works, that
because they have no such thoughts put before them in English authors,
no such thoughts exist in them.</p>
<p>But happily we may do much towards mending this state of things,
by making our pupils thoroughly conversant with the &aelig;sthetic treasures
of English literature.&nbsp; From them I firmly believe they may derive
sufficient rules whereby to separate in foreign books the true from
the false, the necessary from the accidental, the eternal truth from
its peculiar national vesture.&nbsp; Above all, we shall give them a
better chance of seeing things from that side from which God intended
English women to see them: for as surely as there is an English view
of everything, so surely God intends us to take that view; and He who
gave us our English character intends us to develop its peculiarities,
as He intends the French woman to develop hers, that so each nation
by learning to understand itself, may learn to understand, and therefore
to profit, by its neighbour.&nbsp; He who has not cultivated his own
plot of ground will hardly know much about the tillage of his neighbour&rsquo;s
land.&nbsp; And she who does not appreciate the mind of her own countrymen
will never form any true judgment of the mind of foreigners.&nbsp; Let
English women be sure that the best way to understand the heroines of
the Continent is not by mimicking them, however noble they may be, not
by trying to become a sham Rahel, or a sham De S&eacute;vign&eacute;,
but a real Elizabeth Fry, Felicia Hemans, or Hannah More.&nbsp; What
indeed entitles either Madame de S&eacute;vign&eacute; or Rahel to fame,
but their very nationality&mdash;that intensely local style of language
and feeling which clothes their genius with a living body instead of
leaving it in the abstractions of a dreary cosmopolitism?&nbsp; The
one I suppose would be called the very beau-ideal, not of woman, but
of the French woman&mdash;the other the ideal, not even of the Jewess,
but of the German Jewess.&nbsp; We may admire wherever we find worth;
but if we try to imitate, we only caricature.&nbsp; Excellence grows
in all climes, transplants to none: the palm luxuriates only in the
tropics, the Alp-rose only beside eternal snows.&nbsp; Only by standing
on our own native earth can we enjoy or even see aright the distant
stars: if we try to reach them, we shall at once lose sight of them,
and drop helpless in a new element, unfitted for our limbs.</p>
<p>Teach, then, the young, by an extended knowledge of English literature,
thoroughly to comprehend the English spirit, thoroughly to see that
the English mind has its peculiar calling on God&rsquo;s earth, which
alone, and no other, it can fulfil.&nbsp; Teach them thoroughly to appreciate
the artistic and intellectual excellences of their own country; but
by no means in a spirit of narrow bigotry: tell them fairly our national
faults&mdash;teach them to unravel those faults from our national virtues;
and then there will be no danger of the prejudiced English woman becoming
by a sudden revulsion an equally prejudiced cosmopolite and eclectic,
as soon as she discovers that her own nation does not monopolise all
human perfections; and so trying to become German, Italian, French woman,
all at once&mdash;a heterogeneous chaos of imitations, very probably
with the faults of all three characters, and the graces of none.&nbsp;
God has given us our own prophets, our own heroines.&nbsp; To recognise
those prophets, to imitate those heroines, is the duty which lies nearest
to the English woman, and therefore the duty which God intends her to
fulfil.</p>
<p>I should wish therefore in the first few lectures on English literature
to glance at the character of our old Saxon ancestors, and the legends
connected with their first invasion of the country; and above all at
the magnificent fables of King Arthur and his times which exercised
so great an influence on the English mind, and were in fact, although
originally Celtic, so thoroughly adopted and naturalised by the Saxon,
as to reappear under different forms in every age, and form the keynote
of most of our fictions, from Geoffrey of Monmouth and the medieval
ballads, up to Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare, and at last Milton and
Blackmore.&nbsp; This series of legends will, I think, as we trace its
development, bring us in contact one by one with the corresponding developments
of the English character; and, unless I am much mistaken, enable us
to explain many of its peculiarities.</p>
<p>Of course nothing more than sketches can be given; but I think nothing
more is required for any one but the professed historian.&nbsp; For
young people especially, it is sufficient to understand the tone of
human feeling expressed by legends, rather than to enter into any critical
dissertations on their historic truth.&nbsp; They need, after all, principles
rather than facts.&nbsp; To educate them truly we must give them inductive
habits of thought, and teach them to deduce from a few facts a law which
makes plain all similar ones, and so acquire the habit of extracting
from every story somewhat of its kernel of spiritual meaning.&nbsp;
But again, to educate them truly we must ourselves have faith; we must
believe that in every one there is a spiritual eye which can perceive
those great principles when they are once fairly presented to it, that
in all there are some noble instincts, some pure yearnings after wisdom,
and taste, and usefulness, which, if we only appeal to them trustfully
through the examples of the past, and the excitements of the present,
will wake into conscious life.&nbsp; Above all, both pupils and teachers
must never forget that all these things were written for their examples;
that though circumstances and creeds, schools and tastes, may alter,
yet the heart of man, and the duty of man, remain unchanged; and that
while</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>The old order changes, giving place to the new,<br />And God fulfils
himself in many ways&mdash;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>yet again</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Through the ages one unaltered purpose runs&mdash;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>and the principles of truth and beauty are the same as when the everlasting
Spirit from whom they come &ldquo;brooded upon the face&rdquo; of the
primeval seas.</p>
<p>But once more, we must and will by God&rsquo;s help try to realise
the purpose of this College, by boldly facing the facts of the age and
of our own office.&nbsp; And therefore we shall not shrink from the
task, however delicate and difficult, of speaking to our hearers as
to women.&nbsp; Our teaching must be no sexless, heartless abstraction.&nbsp;
We must try to make all which we tell them bear on the great purpose
of unfolding to woman her own calling in all ages&mdash;her especial
calling in this one.&nbsp; We must incite them to realise the chivalrous
belief of our old forefathers among their Saxon forests, that something
Divine dwelt in the counsels of woman; but, on the other hand, we must
continually remind them that they will attain that divine instinct,
not by renouncing their sex, but by fulfilling it; by becoming true
women, and not bad imitations of men; by educating their heads for the
sake of their hearts, not their hearts for the sake of their heads;
by claiming woman&rsquo;s divine vocation, as the priestess of purity,
of beauty, and of love; by educating themselves to become, with God&rsquo;s
blessing, worthy wives and mothers of a mighty nation of workers, in
an age when the voice of the ever-working God is proclaiming through
the thunder of falling dynasties, and crumbling idols: &ldquo;He that
will not work, neither shall he eat.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>This lecture is intended to be suggestive rather than didactic; to
set you thinking and inquiring for yourselves, rather than learning
at second-hand from me.&nbsp; Some among my audience, I doubt not, will
neither need to be taught by me, nor to be stirred up to inquiry for
themselves.&nbsp; They are already, probably, antiquarians; already
better acquainted with the subject than I am.&nbsp; But they will, I
hope, remember that I am only trying to excite a general interest in
that very architecture in which they delight, and so to make the public
do justice to their labours.&nbsp; They will therefore, I trust&mdash;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Be to my faults a little blind,<br />Be to my virtues very kind&mdash;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>and if my architectural theories do not seem to them correct in all
details&mdash;well-founded I believe them myself to be&mdash;remember
that if it be a light matter to me, or to the audience, whether any
special and pet fancy of mine should be exactly true or not; yet it
is not a light matter that my hearers should be awakened&mdash;and too
many just now need an actual awakening&mdash;to a right, pure, and wholesome
judgment on questions of art, especially when the soundness of that
judgment depends, as in this case, on sound judgments about human history,
as well as about natural objects.</p>
<p>Now, it befell me that, fresh from the tropic forests, and with their
forms hanging always as it were in the background of my eye, I was impressed
more and more vividly the longer I looked, with the likeness of those
forest forms to the forms of our own Cathedral of Chester.&nbsp; The
grand and graceful Chapter-house transformed itself into one of those
green bowers, which, once seen, and never to be seen again, make one
at once richer and poorer for the rest of life.&nbsp; The fans of groining
sprang from the short columns, just as do the feathered boughs of the
far more beautiful Maximiliana palm, and just of the same size and shape;
and met overhead, as I have seen them meet, in aisles longer by far
than our cathedral nave.&nbsp; The free upright shafts, which give such
strength, and yet such lightness, to the mullions of each window, pierced
upward through those curving lines, as do the stems of young trees through
the fronds of palm; and, like them, carried the eye and the fancy up
into the infinite, and took off a sense of oppression and captivity
which the weight of the roof might have produced.&nbsp; In the nave,
in the choir, the same vision of the tropic forest haunted me.&nbsp;
The fluted columns not only resembled, but seemed copied from the fluted
stems beneath which I had ridden in the primeval woods; their bases,
their capitals, seemed copied from the bulgings at the collar of the
root, and at the spring of the boughs, produced by a check of the redundant
sap; and were garlanded often enough, like the capitals of the columns,
with delicate tracery of parasite leaves and flowers; the mouldings
of the arches seemed copied from the parallel bundles of the curving
bamboo shoots; and even the flatter roof of the nave and transepts had
its antitype in that highest level of the forest aisles where the trees,
having climbed at last to the light-food which they seek, care no longer
to grow upward, but spread out in huge limbs, almost horizontal, reminding
the eye of the four-centred arch which marks the period of perpendicular
Gothic.</p>
<p>Nay, to this day there is one point in our cathedral which, to me,
keeps up the illusion still.&nbsp; As I enter the choir, and look upward
toward the left, I cannot help seeing, in the tabernacle work of the
stalls, the slender and aspiring forms of the &ldquo;rastrajo;&rdquo;
the delicate second growth which, as it were, rushes upward from the
earth wherever the forest is cleared; and above it, in the tall lines
of the north-west pier of the tower&mdash;even though defaced, along
the inner face of the western arch, by ugly and needless perpendicular
panelling&mdash;I seem to see the stems of huge cedars, or balatas,
or ceibas, curving over, as they would do, into the great beams of the
transept roof, some seventy feet above the ground.</p>
<p>Nay, so far will the fancy lead, that I have seemed to see, in the
stained glass between the tracery of the windows, such gorgeous sheets
of colour as sometimes flash on the eye, when, far aloft, between high
stems and boughs, you catch sight of some great tree ablaze with flowers,
either its own or those of a parasite; yellow or crimson, white or purple;
and over them again the cloudless blue.</p>
<p>Now, I know well that all these dreams are dreams; that the men who
built our northern cathedrals never saw these forest forms; and that
the likeness of their work to those of tropic nature is at most only
a corroboration of Mr. Ruskin&rsquo;s dictum, that &ldquo;the Gothic
did not arise out of, but developed itself into, a resemblance to vegetation
. . . It was no chance suggestion of the form of an arch from the bending
of a bough, but the gradual and continual discovery of a beauty in natural
forms which could be more and more transferred into those of stone,
which influenced at once the hearts of the people and the form of the
edifice.&rdquo;&nbsp; So true is this, that by a pure and noble copying
of the vegetable beauty which they had seen in their own clime, the
medieval craftsmen went so far&mdash;as I have shown you&mdash;as to
anticipate forms of vegetable beauty peculiar to tropic climes, which
they had not seen; a fresh proof, if proof were needed, that beauty
is something absolute and independent of man; and not, as some think,
only relative, and what happens to be pleasant to the eye of this man
or that.</p>
<p>But thinking over this matter, and reading over, too, that which
Mr. Ruskin has written thereon in his &ldquo;Stones of Venice,&rdquo;
vol. ii. cap. vi., on the nature of Gothic, I came to certain further
conclusions&mdash;or at least surmises&mdash;which I put before you
to-night, in hopes that if they have no other effect on you, they will
at least stir some of you up to read Mr. Ruskin&rsquo;s works.</p>
<p>Now Mr. Ruskin says: &ldquo;That the original conception of Gothic
architecture has been derived from vegetation, from the symmetry of
avenues and the interlacing of branches, is a strange and vain supposition.&nbsp;
It is a theory which never could have existed for a moment in the mind
of any person acquainted with early Gothic; but, however idle as a theory,
it is most valuable as a testimony to the character of the perfected
style.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doubtless so.&nbsp; But you must remember always that the subject
of my lecture is Grots and Groves; that I am speaking not of Gothic
architecture in general, but of Gothic ecclesiastical architecture;
and more, almost exclusively of the ecclesiastical architecture of the
Teutonic or northern nations; because in them, as I think, the resemblance
between the temple and the forest reached the fullest exactness.</p>
<p>Now the original idea of a Christian church was that of a grot&mdash;a
cave.&nbsp; That is a historic fact.&nbsp; The Christianity which was
passed on to us began to worship, hidden and persecuted, in the catacombs
of Rome, it may be often around the martyrs&rsquo; tombs, by the dim
light of candle or of torch.&nbsp; The candles on the Roman altars,
whatever they have been made to symbolise since then, are the hereditary
memorials of that fact.&nbsp; Throughout the North, in these isles as
much as in any land, the idea of the grot was, in like wise, the idea
of a church.&nbsp; The saint or hermit built himself a cell; dark, massive,
intended to exclude light as well as weather; or took refuge in a cave.&nbsp;
There he prayed and worshipped, and gathered others to pray and worship
round him, during his life.&nbsp; There he, often enough, became an
object of worship in his turn, after his death.&nbsp; In after ages
his cave was ornamented, like that of the hermit of Montmajour by Arles;
or his cell-chapel enlarged, as those of the Scotch and Irish saints
have been, again and again; till at last a stately minster rose above
it.&nbsp; Still, the idea that the church was to be a grot haunted the
minds of builders.</p>
<p>But side by side with the Christian grot there was throughout the
North another form of temple, dedicated to very different gods, namely,
the trees from whose mighty stems hung the heads of the victims of Odin
or of Thor&mdash;the horse, the goat, and, in time of calamity or pestilence,
of men.&nbsp; Trees and not grots were the temples of our forefathers.</p>
<p>Scholars know well&mdash;but they must excuse my quoting it for the
sake of those who are not scholars&mdash;the famous passage of Tacitus
which tells how our forefathers &ldquo;held it beneath the dignity of
the gods to coop them within walls, or liken them to any human countenance;
but consecrated groves and woods, and called by the name of gods that
mystery which they held by faith alone;&rdquo; and the equally famous
passage of Claudian, about &ldquo;the vast silence of the Black Forest,
and groves awful with ancient superstition; and oaks, barbarian deities;&rdquo;
and Lucan&rsquo;s &ldquo;groves inviolate from all antiquity, and altars
stained with human blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To worship in such spots was an abomination to the early Christian.&nbsp;
It was as much a test of heathendom as the eating of horse-flesh, sacred
to Odin, and therefore unclean to Christian men.&nbsp; The Lombard laws
and others forbid expressly the lingering remnants of grove worship.&nbsp;
St. Boniface and other early missionaries hewed down in defiance the
sacred oaks, and paid sometimes for their valour with their lives.</p>
<p>It is no wonder, then, if long centuries elapsed ere the likeness
of vegetable forms began to reappear in the Christian churches of the
North.&nbsp; And yet both grot and grove were equally the natural temples
which the religious instinct of all deep-hearted peoples, conscious
of sin, and conscious, too, of yearnings after a perfection not to be
found on earth, chooses from the earliest stage of awakening civilisation.&nbsp;
In them, alone, before he had strength and skill to build nobly for
himself, could man find darkness, the mother of mystery and awe, in
which he is reminded perforce of his own ignorance and weakness; in
which he learns first to remember unseen powers, sometimes to his comfort
and elevation, sometimes only to his terror and debasement; darkness;
and with it silence and solitude, in which he can collect himself, and
shut out the noise and glare, the meanness and the coarseness of the
world; and be alone awhile with his own thoughts, his own fancy, his
own conscience, his own soul.</p>
<p>But for awhile, as I have said, that darkness, solitude, and silence
were to be sought in the grot, not in the grove.</p>
<p>Then Christianity conquered the Empire.&nbsp; It adapted, not merely
its architecture, but its very buildings, to its worship.&nbsp; The
Roman Basilica became the Christian church; a noble form of building
enough, though one in which was neither darkness, solitude, nor silence,
but crowded congregations, clapping&mdash;or otherwise&mdash;the popular
preacher; or fighting about the election of a bishop or a pope, till
the holy place ran with Christian blood.&nbsp; The deep-hearted Northern
turned away, in weariness and disgust, from those vast halls, fitted
only for the feverish superstition of a profligate and worn-out civilisation;
and took himself, amid his own rocks and forests, moors and shores,
to a simpler and sterner architecture, which should express a creed,
sterner, and at heart far simpler, though dogmatically the same.</p>
<p>And this is, to my mind, the difference, and the noble difference,
between the so-called Norman architecture, which came hither about the
time of the Conquest; and that of Romanised Italy.</p>
<p>But the Normans were a conquering race; and one which conquered,
be it always remembered, in England at least, in the name and by the
authority of Rome.&nbsp; Their ecclesiastics, like the ecclesiastics
on the Continent, were the representatives of Roman civilisation, of
Rome&rsquo;s right, intellectual and spiritual, to rule the world.</p>
<p>Therefore their architecture, like their creed, was Roman.&nbsp;
They took the massive towering Roman forms, which expressed domination;
and piled them one on the other, to express the domination of Christian
Rome over the souls, as they had represented the domination of heathen
Rome over the bodies of men.&nbsp; And so side by side with the towers
of the Norman keep rose the towers of the Norman cathedral&mdash;the
two signs of a double servitude.</p>
<p>But with the thirteenth century there dawned an age in Northern Europe
which I may boldly call an heroic age&mdash;heroic in its virtues and
in its crimes; an age of rich passionate youth, or rather of early manhood;
full of aspirations of chivalry, of self-sacrifice as strange and terrible
as it was beautiful and noble, even when most misguided.&nbsp; The Teutonic
nations of Europe&mdash;our own forefathers most of all&mdash;having
absorbed all that heathen Rome could teach them, at least for the time
being, began to think for themselves; to have poets, philosophers, historians,
architects, of their own.&nbsp; The thirteenth century was especially
an age of aspiration; and its architects expressed, in building, quite
unlike those of the preceding centuries, the aspirations of the time.</p>
<p>The Pointed Arch had been introduced half a century before.&nbsp;
It may be that the Crusaders saw it in the East and brought it home.&nbsp;
It may be that it originated from the quadripartite vaulting of the
Normans, the segmental groins of which, crossing diagonally, produced
to appearance the pointed arch.&nbsp; It may be that it was derived
from that mystical figure of a pointed oval form, the vesica piscis.&nbsp;
It may be, lastly, that it was suggested simply by the intersection
of semicircular arches, so frequently found in ornamental arcades.&nbsp;
The last cause may perhaps be the true one; but it matters little whence
the pointed arch came.&nbsp; It matters much what it meant to those
who introduced it.&nbsp; And at the beginning of the Transition or semi-Norman
period, it seems to have meant nothing.&nbsp; It was not till the thirteenth
century that it had gradually received, as it were, a soul, and had
become the exponent of a great idea.&nbsp; As the Norman architecture
and its forms had signified domination, so the Early English, as we
call it, signified aspiration&mdash;an idea which was perfected, as
far as it could be, in what we call the Decorated style.</p>
<p>There is an evident gap, I had almost said a gulf, between the architectural
mind of the eleventh and that of the thirteenth century.&nbsp; A vertical
tendency, a longing after lightness and freedom appears; and with them
a longing to reproduce the graces of nature and art.&nbsp; And here
I ask you to look for yourselves at the buildings of this new era&mdash;there
is a beautiful specimen in yonder arcade <a name="citation278"></a><a href="#footnote278">{278}</a>&mdash;and
judge for yourselves whether they, and even more than they the Decorated
style into which they developed, do not remind you of the forest shapes?</p>
<p>And if they remind you, must they not have reminded those who shaped
them?&nbsp; Can it have been otherwise?&nbsp; We know that the men who
built were earnest.&nbsp; The carefulness, the reverence, of their work
have given a subject for some of Mr. Ruskin&rsquo;s noblest chapters,
a text for some of his noblest sermons.&nbsp; We know that they were
students of vegetable form.&nbsp; That is proved by the flowers, the
leaves, even the birds, with which they enwreathed their capitals and
enriched their mouldings.&nbsp; Look up there, and see.</p>
<p>You cannot look at any good church-work from the thirteenth to the
middle of the fifteenth century, with out seeing that leaves and flowers
were perpetually in the workman&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp; Do you fancy that
stems and boughs were never in his mind?&nbsp; He kept, doubtless, in
remembrance the fundamental idea, that the Christian church should symbolise
a grot or cave.&nbsp; He could do no less; while he again and again
saw hermits around him dwelling and worshipping in caves, as they had
done ages before in Egypt and Syria; while he fixed, again and again,
the site of his convent and his minster in some secluded valley guarded
by cliffs and rocks, like Vale Crucis in North Wales.&nbsp; But his
minster stood often not among rocks only, but amid trees; in some clearing
in the primeval forest, as Vale Crucis was then.&nbsp; At least he could
not pass from minster to minster, from town to town, without journeying
through long miles of forest.&nbsp; Do you think that the awful shapes
and shadows of that forest never haunted his imagination as he built?&nbsp;
He would have cut down ruthlessly, as his predecessors the early missionaries
did, the sacred trees amid which Thor and Odin had been worshipped by
the heathen Saxons; amid which still darker deities were still worshipped
by the heathen tribes of Eastern Europe.&nbsp; But he was the descendant
of men who had worshipped in those groves, and the glamour of them was
upon him still.&nbsp; He peopled the wild forest with demons and fairies;
but that did not surely prevent his feeling its ennobling grandeur,
its chastening loneliness.&nbsp; His ancestors had held the oaks for
trees of God, even as the Jews held the cedar, and the Hindoos likewise;
for the Deodara pine is not only, botanists tell us, the same as the
cedar of Lebanon, but its very name&mdash;the Deodara&mdash;signifies
naught else but &ldquo;the tree of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His ancestors, I say, had held the oaks for trees of God.&nbsp; It
may be that as the monk sat beneath their shade with his bible on his
knee, like good St. Boniface in the Fulda forest, he found that his
ancestors were right.</p>
<p>To understand what sort of trees they were from which he got his
inspiration, you must look, not at an average English wood, perpetually
thinned out as the trees arrive at middle age.&nbsp; Still less must
you look at the pines, oaks, beeches, of an English park, where each
tree has had space to develop itself freely into a more or less rounded
form.&nbsp; You must not even look at the tropic forests.&nbsp; For
there, from the immense diversity of forms, twenty varieties of tree
will grow beneath each other, forming a close-packed heap of boughs
and leaves, from the ground to a hundred feet and more aloft.</p>
<p>You should look at the North American forests of social trees&mdash;especially
of pines and firs, where trees of one species, crowded together, and
competing with equal advantages for the air and light, form themselves
into one wilderness of straight smooth shafts, surmounted by a flat
sheet of foliage, held up by boughs like the ribs of a groined roof,
while underneath the ground is bare as a cathedral floor.</p>
<p>You all know, surely, the Hemlock spruce of America; which, while
growing by itself in open ground, is the most wilful and fantastic,
as well as the most graceful, of all the firs; imitating the shape,
not of its kindred, but of an enormous tuft of fern.</p>
<p>Yet if you look at the same tree, when it has struggled long for
life from its youth amid other trees of its own kind and its own age,
you find that the lower boughs have died off from want of light, leaving
not a scar behind.&nbsp; The upper boughs have reached at once the light
and their natural term of years.&nbsp; They are content to live, and
little more.&nbsp; The central trunk no longer sends up each year a
fresh perpendicular shoot to aspire above the rest, but, as weary of
struggling ambition as they are, is content to become more and more
their equal as the years pass by.&nbsp; And this is a law of social
forest trees, which you must bear in mind whenever I speak of the influence
of tree-forms on Gothic architecture.</p>
<p>Such forms as these are rare enough in Europe now.</p>
<p>I never understood how possible, how common they must have been in
medieval Europe, till I saw in the forest of Fontainebleau a few oaks,
like the oak of Charlemagne and the Bouquet du Roi, at whose age I dare
not guess, but whose size and shape showed them to have once formed
part of a continuous wood, the like whereof remains not in these isles&mdash;perhaps
not east of the Carpathian mountains.&nbsp; In them a clear shaft of
at least sixty, it may be eighty feet, carries a flat head of boughs,
each in itself a tree.&nbsp; In such a grove, I thought, the heathen
Gaul, even the heathen Frank, worshipped beneath &ldquo;trees of God.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Such trees, I thought, centuries after, inspired the genius of every
builder of Gothic aisles and roofs.</p>
<p>Thus, at least, we can explain that rigidity, which Mr. Ruskin tells
us, &ldquo;is a special element of Gothic architecture.&nbsp; Greek
and Egyptian buildings,&rdquo; he says&mdash;and I should have added,
Roman building also, in proportion to their age, <i>i.e</i>. to the
amount of the Roman elements in them&mdash;&ldquo;stand for the most
part by their own weight and mass, one stone passively incumbent on
another: but in the Gothic vaults and traceries there is a stiffness
analogous to that of the bones of a limb, or fibres of a tree; an elastic
tension and communication of force from part to part; and also a studious
expression of this throughout every part of the building.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In a word, Gothic vaulting and tracery have been studiously made like
to boughs of trees.&nbsp; Were those boughs present to the mind of the
architect?&nbsp; Or is the coincidence merely fortuitous?&nbsp; You
know already how I should answer.&nbsp; The cusped arch, too, was it
actually not intended to imitate vegetation?&nbsp; Mr. Ruskin seems
to think so.&nbsp; He says that it is merely the special application
to the arch of the great ornamental system of foliation, which, &ldquo;whether
simple as in the cusped arch, or complicated as in tracery, arose out
of the love of leafage.&nbsp; Not that the form of the arch is intended
to imitate a leaf, &ldquo;but to be invested with the same characters
of beauty which the designer had discovered in the leaf.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Now I differ from Mr. Ruskin with extreme hesitation.&nbsp; I agree
that the cusped arch is not meant to imitate a leaf.&nbsp; I think with
Mr. Ruskin, that it was probably first adopted on account of its superior
strength; and that it afterwards took the form of a bough.&nbsp; But
I cannot as yet believe that it was not at last intended to imitate
a bough; a bough of a very common form, and one in which &ldquo;active
rigidity&rdquo; is peculiarly shown.&nbsp; I mean a bough which has
forked.&nbsp; If the lower fork has died off, for want of light, we
obtain something like the simply cusped arch.&nbsp; If it be still living&mdash;but
short and stunted in comparison with the higher fork&mdash;we obtain,
it seems to me, something like the foliated cusp; both likenesses being
near enough to those of common objects to make it possible that those
objects may have suggested them.&nbsp; And thus, more and more boldly,
the medieval architect learnt to copy boughs, stems, and at last, the
whole effect, as far always as stone would allow, of a combination of
rock and tree, of grot and grove.</p>
<p>So he formed his minsters, as I believe, upon the model of those
leafy minsters in which he walked to meditate, amid the aisles which
God, not man, has built.&nbsp; He sent their columns aloft like the
boles of ancient trees.&nbsp; He wreathed their capitals, sometimes
their very shafts, with flowers and creeping shoots.&nbsp; He threw
their arches out, and interwove the groinings of their vaults, like
the bough-roofage overhead.&nbsp; He decked with foliage and fruit the
bosses above and the corbels below.&nbsp; He sent up out of those corbels
upright shafts along the walls, in the likeness of the trees which sprang
out of the rocks above his head.&nbsp; He raised those walls into great
cliffs.&nbsp; He pierced them with the arches of the triforium, as with
hermits&rsquo; cells.&nbsp; He represented in the horizontal sills of
his windows, and in his horizontal string-courses, the horizontal strata
of the rocks.&nbsp; He opened the windows into high and lofty glades,
broken, as in the forest, by the tracery of stems and boughs, through
which was seen, not merely the outer, but the upper world.&nbsp; For
he craved, as all true artists crave, for light and colour; and had
the sky above been one perpetual blue, he might have been content with
it, and left his glass transparent.&nbsp; But in that dark, dank, northern
clime, rain and snowstorm, black cloud and gray mist, were all that
he was like to see outside for nine months in the year.&nbsp; So he
took such light and colour as nature gave in her few gayer moods; and
set aloft his stained-glass windows, the hues of the noonday and the
rainbow, and the sunrise and the sunset, and the purple of the heather,
and the gold of the gorse, and the azure of the bugloss, and the crimson
of the poppy; and among them, in gorgeous robes, the angels and the
saints of heaven, and the memories of heroic virtues and heroic sufferings,
that he might lift up his own eyes and heart for ever out of the dark,
dank, sad world of the cold north, with all its coarsenesses and its
crimes, toward a realm of perpetual holiness, amid a perpetual summer
of beauty and of light; as one who&mdash;for he was true to nature,
even in that&mdash;from between the black jaws of a narrow glen, or
from beneath the black shade of gnarled trees, catches a glimpse of
far lands gay with gardens and cottages, and purple mountain ranges,
and the far-off sea, and the hazy horizon melting into the hazy sky;
and finds his heart carried out into an infinite at once of freedom
and of repose.</p>
<p>And so out of the cliffs and the forests he shaped the inside of
his church.&nbsp; And how did he shape the outside?&nbsp; Look for yourselves,
and judge.&nbsp; But look, not at Chester, but at Salisbury.&nbsp; Look
at those churches which carry not mere towers, but spires, or at least
pinnacled towers approaching the pyramidal form.&nbsp; The outside form
of every Gothic cathedral must be considered imperfect if it does not
culminate in something pyramidal.</p>
<p>The especial want of all Greek and Roman buildings with which we
are acquainted is the absence&mdash;save in a few and unimportant cases&mdash;of
the pyramidal form.&nbsp; The Egyptians knew at least the worth of the
obelisk; but the Greeks and Romans hardly knew even that: their buildings
are flat-topped.&nbsp; Their builders were contented with the earth
as it was.&nbsp; There was a great truth involved in that; which I am
the last to deny.</p>
<p>But religions which, like the Buddhist or the Christian, nurse a
noble self-discontent, are sure to adopt sooner or later an upward and
aspiring form of building.&nbsp; It is not merely that, fancying heaven
to be above earth, they point towards heaven.&nbsp; There is a deeper
natural language in the pyramidal form of a growing tree.&nbsp; It symbolises
growth, or the desire of growth.&nbsp; The Norman tower does nothing
of the kind.&nbsp; It does not aspire to grow.&nbsp; Look&mdash;I mention
an instance with which I am most familiar&mdash;at the Norman tower
of Bury St. Edmund&rsquo;s.&nbsp; It is graceful&mdash;awful, if you
will&mdash;but there is no aspiration in it.&nbsp; It is stately, but
self-content.&nbsp; Its horizontal courses, circular arches, above all,
its flat sky-line, seem to have risen enough, and wish to rise no higher.&nbsp;
For it has no touch of that unrest of soul which is expressed by the
spire, and still more by the compound spire, with its pinnacles, crockets,
finials&mdash;which are finials only in name; for they do not finish,
and are really terminal buds, as it were, longing to open and grow upward,
even as the crockets are bracts and leaves thrown off as the shoot has
grown.</p>
<p>You feel, surely, the truth of these last words.&nbsp; You cannot
look at the canopy work or the pinnacle work of this cathedral without
seeing that they do not merely suggest buds and leaves, but that the
buds and leaves are there carven before your eyes.&nbsp; I myself cannot
look at the tabernacle work of our stalls without being reminded of
the young pine forests which clothe the Hampshire moors.&nbsp; But if
the details are copied from vegetable forms, why not the whole?&nbsp;
Is not a spire like a growing tree, a tabernacle like a fir-tree, a
compound spire like a group of firs?&nbsp; And if we can see that, do
you fancy that the man who planned the spire did not see it as clearly
as we do; and perhaps more clearly still?</p>
<p>I am aware, of course, that Norman architecture had sometimes its
pinnacle, a mere conical or polygonal capping.&nbsp; I am aware that
this form, only more and more slender, lasted on in England during the
thirteenth and the early part of the fourteenth century; and on the
Continent under many modifications, one English kind whereof is usually
called a &ldquo;broach,&rdquo; of which you have a beautiful specimen
in the new church at Hoole.</p>
<p>Now, no one will deny that that broach is beautiful.&nbsp; But it
would be difficult to prove that its form was taken from a North European
tree.&nbsp; The cypress was unknown, probably, to our northern architects.&nbsp;
The Lombardy poplar&mdash;which has wandered hither, I know not when,
all the way from Cashmere&mdash;had not wandered then, I believe, farther
than North Italy.&nbsp; The form is rather that of mere stone; of the
obelisk or of the mountain-peak; and they, in fact, may have at first
suggested the spire.&nbsp; The grandeur of an isolated mountain, even
of a dolmen or single upright stone, is evident to all.</p>
<p>But it is the grandeur not of aspiration, but of defiance; not of
the Christian, not even of the Stoic, but rather of the Epicurean.&nbsp;
It says&mdash;I cannot rise.&nbsp; I do not care to rise.&nbsp; I will
be contentedly and valiantly that which I am; and face circumstances,
though I cannot conquer them.&nbsp; But it is defiance under defeat.&nbsp;
The mountain-peak does not grow, but only decays.&nbsp; Fretted by rains,
peeled by frost, splintered by lightning, it must down at last; and
crumble into earth, were it as old, as hard, as lofty as the Matterhorn
itself.&nbsp; And while it stands, it wants not only aspiration, it
wants tenderness; it wants humility; it wants the unrest which tenderness
and humility must breed, and which Mr. Ruskin so clearly recognises
in the best Gothic art.&nbsp; And, meanwhile, it wants naturalness.&nbsp;
The mere smooth spire or broach&mdash;I had almost said, even the spire
of Salisbury&mdash;is like no tall or commanding object in nature.&nbsp;
It is merely the caricature of one&mdash;it may be of the mountain-peak.&nbsp;
The outline must be broken, must be softened, before it can express
the soul of a creed which in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries,
far more than now, was one of penitence as well as of aspiration, of
passionate emotion as well as of lofty faith.&nbsp; But a shape which
will express that soul must be sought, not among mineral, but among
vegetable, forms.&nbsp; And remember always, if we feel thus even now,
how much more must those medieval men of genius have felt thus, whose
work we now dare only copy line by line?</p>
<p>So&mdash;as it seems to me&mdash;they sought among vegetable forms
for what they needed: and they found it at once in the pine, or rather
the fir&mdash;the spruce and silver firs of their own forests.&nbsp;
They are not, of course, indigenous to England.&nbsp; But they are so
common through all the rest of Europe, that not only would the form
suggest itself to a continental architect, but to any English clerk
who travelled, as all did who could, across the Alps to Rome.&nbsp;
The fir-tree, not growing on level ground, like the oaks of Fontainebleau,
into one flat roof of foliage, but clinging to the hillside and the
crag, old above young, spire above spire, whorl above whorl&mdash;for
the young shoots of each whorl of boughs point upward in the spring;
and now and then a whole bough breaking away, as it were, into free
space, turns upward altogether, and forms a secondary spire on the same
tree&mdash;this surely was the form which the medieval architect seized,
to clothe with it the sides and roof of the stone mountain which he
had built; piling up pinnacles and spires, each crocketed at the angles;
that, like a group of firs upon an isolated rock, every point of the
building might seem in act to grow toward heaven, till his idea culminated
in that glorious Minster of Cologne, which, if it ever be completed,
will be the likeness of one forest-clothed group of cliffs, surrounded
by three enormous pines.</p>
<p>One feature of the Norman temple he could keep; for it was copied
from the same Nature which he was trying to copy&mdash;namely, the high-pitched
roof and gables.&nbsp; Mr. Ruskin lays it down as a law, that the acute
angle in roofs, gables, spires, is the distinguishing mark of northern
Gothic.&nbsp; It was adopted, most probably, at first from domestic
buildings.&nbsp; A northern house or barn must have a high-pitched roof,
or the snow will not slip off it.&nbsp; But that fact was not discovered
by man; it was copied by him from the rocks around.&nbsp; He saw the
mountain-peak jut black and bare above the snows of winter; he saw those
snows slip down in sheets, rush down in torrents under the sun, from
the steep slabs of rock which coped the hillside; and he copied, in
his roofs, the rocks above his town.&nbsp; But as the love for decorations
arose, he would deck his roofs as nature had decked hers, till the gray
sheets of the cathedral slates should stand out amid pinnacles and turrets
rich with foliage, as the gray mountain-sides stood out amid knolls
of feathery birch and towering pine.</p>
<p>He failed, though he failed nobly.&nbsp; He never succeeded in attaining
a perfectly natural style.</p>
<p>The medieval architects were crippled to the last by the tradition
of artificial Roman forms.&nbsp; They began improving them into naturalness,
without any clear notion of what they wanted; and when that notion became
clear, it was too late.&nbsp; Take, as an instance, the tracery of their
windows.&nbsp; It is true, as Mr. Ruskin says, that they began by piercing
holes in a wall of the form of a leaf, which developed, in the rose
window, into the form of a star inside, and of a flower outside.&nbsp;
Look at such aloft there.&nbsp; Then, by introducing mullions and traceries
into the lower part of the window, they added stem and bough forms to
those flower forms.&nbsp; But the two did not fit.&nbsp; Look at the
west window of our choir, and you will see what I mean.&nbsp; The upright
mullions break off into bough curves graceful enough: but these are
cut short&mdash;as I hold, spoiled&mdash;by circular and triangular
forms of rose and trefoil resting on them as such forms never rest in
nature; and the whole, though beautiful, is only half beautiful.&nbsp;
It is fragmentary, unmeaning&mdash;barbaric, because unnatural.</p>
<p>They failed too, it may be, from the very paucity of the vegetable
forms they could find to copy among the flora of this colder clime;
and so, stopped short in drawing from nature, ran off into mere purposeless
luxuriance.&nbsp; Had they been able to add to their stock of memories
a hundred forms which they would have seen in the tropics, they might
have gone on for centuries copying nature without exhausting her.</p>
<p>And yet, did they exhaust even the few forms of beauty which they
saw around them?&nbsp; It must be confessed that they did not.&nbsp;
I believe that they could not, because they dared not.&nbsp; The unnaturalness
of the creed which they expressed always hampered them.&nbsp; It forbade
them to look Nature freely and lovingly in the face.&nbsp; It forbade
them&mdash;as one glaring example&mdash;to know anything truly of the
most beautiful of all natural objects&mdash;the human form.&nbsp; They
were tempted perpetually to take Nature as ornament, not as basis; and
they yielded at last to the temptation; till, in the age of Perpendicular
architecture, their very ornament became unnatural again; because conventional,
untrue, meaningless.</p>
<p>But the creed for which they worked was dying by that time, and therefore
the art which expressed it must needs die too.&nbsp; And even that death,
or rather the approach of it, was symbolised truly in the flatter roof,
the four-centred arch, the flat-topped tower of the fifteenth-century
church.&nbsp; The creed had ceased to aspire: so did the architecture.&nbsp;
It had ceased to grow: so did the temple.&nbsp; And the arch sank lower;
and the rafters grew more horizontal; and the likeness to the old tree,
content to grow no more, took the place of the likeness to the young
tree struggling toward the sky.</p>
<p>And now&mdash;unless you are tired of listening to me&mdash;a few
practical words.</p>
<p>We are restoring our old cathedral stone by stone after its ancient
model.&nbsp; We are also trying to build a new church.&nbsp; We are
building it&mdash;as most new churches in England are now built&mdash;in
a pure Gothic style.</p>
<p>Are we doing right?&nbsp; I do not mean morally right.&nbsp; It is
always morally right to build a new church, if needed, whatever be its
architecture.&nbsp; It is always morally right to restore an old church,
if it be beautiful and noble, as an heirloom handed down to us by our
ancestors, which we have no right&mdash;I say no right&mdash;for the
sake of our children, and of our children&rsquo;s children, to leave
to ruin.</p>
<p>But are we artistically, &aelig;sthetically right?&nbsp; Is the best
Gothic fit for our worship?&nbsp; Does it express our belief?&nbsp;
Or shall we choose some other style?</p>
<p>I say that it is; and that it is so because it is a style which,
if not founded on Nature, has taken into itself more of nature, of nature
beautiful and healthy, than any other style.</p>
<p>With greater knowledge of nature, both geographical and scientific,
fresh styles of architecture may and will arise, as much more beautiful,
and as much more natural, than the Gothic, as Gothic is more beautiful
and natural than the Norman.&nbsp; Till then we must take the best models
which we have; use them; and, as it were, use them up and exhaust them.&nbsp;
By that time we may have learnt to improve on them; and to build churches
more Gothic than Gothic itself, more like grot and grove than even a
northern cathedral.</p>
<p>That is the direction in which we must work.&nbsp; And if any shall
say to us, as it has been said ere now&mdash;&ldquo;After all, your
new Gothic churches are but imitations, shams, borrowed symbols, which
to you symbolise nothing.&nbsp; They are Romish churches, meant to express
Romish doctrine, built for a Protestant creed which they do not express,
and for a Protestant worship which they will not fit.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then
we shall answer&mdash;Not so.&nbsp; The objection might be true if we
built Norman or Romanesque churches; for we should then be returning
to that very foreign and unnatural style which Rome taught our forefathers,
and from which they escaped gradually into the comparative freedom,
the comparative naturalness, of that true Gothic of which Mr. Ruskin
says so well:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>It is gladdening to remember that, in its utmost nobleness, the very
temper which has been thought most adverse to it, the Protestant temper
of self-dependence and inquiry, were expressed in every case.&nbsp;
Faith and aspiration there were in every Christian ecclesiastical building
from the first century to the fifteenth: but the moral habits to which
England in this age owes the kind of greatness which she has&mdash;the
habits of philosophical investigation, of accurate thought, of domestic
seclusion and independence, of stern self-reliance, and sincere upright
searching into religious truth&mdash;were only traceable in the features
which were the distinctive creations of the Gothic schools, in the varied
foliage and thorny fretwork, and shadowy niche, and buttressed pier,
and fearless height of subtle pinnacle and crested tower, sent &ldquo;like
an unperplexed question up to heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>So says Mr. Ruskin.&nbsp; I, for one, endorse his gallant words.&nbsp;
And I think that a strong proof of their truth is to be found in two
facts, which seem at first paradoxical.&nbsp; First, that the new Roman
Catholic churches on the Continent&mdash;I speak especially of France,
which is the most highly-cultivated Romanist country&mdash;are like
those which the Jesuits built in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,
less and less Gothic.&nbsp; The former were sham-classic; the latter
are rather of a new fantastic Romanesque, or rather Byzantinesque style,
which is a real retrogression from Gothic towards earlier and less natural
schools.&nbsp; Next, that the Puritan communions, the Kirk of Scotland
and the English Nonconformists, as they are becoming more cultivated&mdash;and
there are now many highly-cultivated men among them&mdash;are introducing
Gothic architecture more and more into their churches.&nbsp; There are
elements in it, it seems, which do not contradict their Puritanism;
elements which they can adapt to their own worship; namely, the very
elements which Mr. Ruskin has discerned.</p>
<p>But if they can do so, how much more can we of the Church of England?&nbsp;
As long as we go on where our medieval forefathers left off; as long
as we keep to the most perfect types of their work, in waiting for the
day when we shall be able to surpass them, by making our work even more
naturalistic than theirs, more truly expressive of the highest aspirations
of humanity; so long we are reverencing them, and that latent Protestantism
in them, which produced at last the Reformation.</p>
<p>And if any should say: &ldquo;Nevertheless your Protestant Gothic
Church, though you made it ten times more beautiful, and more symbolic
than Cologne Minster itself, would still be a sham.&nbsp; For where
would be your images?&nbsp; And still more, where would be your Host?&nbsp;
Do you not know that in the medieval church the vistas of its arcades,
the alternation of its lights and shadows, the gradations of its colouring,
and all its carefully subordinated wealth of art, pointed to, were concentrated
round, one sacred spot, as a curve, however vast its sweep through space,
tends at every moment toward a single focus?&nbsp; And that spot, that
focus was, and is still in every Romish church, the body of God, present
upon the altar in the form of bread?&nbsp; Without Him, what is all
your building?&nbsp; Your church is empty; your altar bare; a throne
without a king; an eye-socket without an eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My friends, if we be true children of those old worthies, whom Tacitus
saw worshipping beneath the German oaks, we shall have but one answer
to that scoff:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know it; and we glory in the fact.&nbsp; We glory in it,
as the old Jews gloried in it, when the Roman soldiers, bursting through
the Temple and into the Holy of Holies itself, paused in wonder and
in awe when they beheld neither God, nor image of God, but&mdash;blank
yet all-suggestive&mdash;the empty mercy-seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like theirs, our altar is an empty throne; for it symbolises
our worship of Him who dwelleth not in temples made with hands; whom
the heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain.&nbsp; Our eye-socket
holds no eye.&nbsp; For it symbolises our worship of that Eye which
is over all the earth; which is about our path, and about our bed, and
spies out all our ways.&nbsp; We need no artificial and material presence
of Deity.&nbsp; For we believe in That One Eternal and Universal Real
Presence&mdash;of which it is written &lsquo;He is not far from anyone
of us; for in God we live and move and have our being;&rsquo; and again:
&lsquo;Lo, I am with you even to the end of the world;&rsquo; and again:
&lsquo;Wheresoever two or three are gathered together in My Name there
am I in the midst of them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is the God of nature, as well as the God of grace.&nbsp;
Forever He looks down on all things which He has made, and behold, they
are very good.&nbsp; And, therefore, we dare offer to Him, in our churches,
the most perfect works of naturalistic art, and shape them into copies
of whatever beauty He has shown us, in man or woman, in cove or mountain-peak,
in tree or flower, even in bird or butterfly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Himself?&mdash;Who can see Him?&nbsp; Except the humble
and the contrite heart, to whom He reveals Himself as a Spirit to be
worshipped in spirit and in truth, and not in bread, nor wood, nor stone,
nor gold, nor quintessential diamond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So we shall obey the sound instinct of our Christian forefathers,
when they shaped their churches into forest aisles, and decked them
with the boughs of the woodland and the flowers of the field: but we
shall obey too, that sounder instinct of theirs, which made them at
last cast out of their own temples, as misplaced and unnatural things,
the idols which they had inherited from Rome.</p>
<p>So we shall obey the sound instinct of our heathen forefathers when
they worshipped the unknown God beneath the oaks of the primeval forests:
but we shall obey, too, that sounder instinct of theirs, which taught
them this, at least, concerning God&mdash;That it was beneath His dignity
to coop Him within walls; and that the grandest forms of nature, as
well as the deepest consciousness of their own souls, revealed to them
a mysterious Being, who was to be beheld by faith alone.</p>

<h2>HOURS WITH THE MYSTICS <a name="citation299"></a><a href="#footnote299">{299}</a></h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Few readers of this magazine probably know anything about &ldquo;Mystics;&rdquo;
know even what the term means: but as it is plainly connected with the
adjective &ldquo;mystical&rdquo; they probably suppose it to denote
some sort of vague, dreamy, sentimental, and therefore useless and undesirable
personage.&nbsp; Nor can we blame them if they do so; for mysticism
is a form of thought and feeling now all but extinct in England.&nbsp;
There are probably not ten thorough mystics among all our millions;
the mystic philosophers are very little read by our scholars, and read
not for, but in spite of, their mysticism; and our popular theology
has so completely rid itself of any mystic elements, that our divines
look with utter disfavour upon it, use the word always as a term of
opprobrium, and interpret the mystic expressions in our liturgy&mdash;which
mostly occur in the Collects&mdash;according to the philosophy of Locke,
really ignorant, it would seem, that they were written by Platonist
mystics.</p>
<p>We do not blame them either, save in as far as teachers of men are
blameworthy for being ignorant of any form of thought which has ever
had a living hold upon good and earnest men, and may therefore take
hold of them again.&nbsp; But the English are not now a mystic people,
any more than the old Romans were; their habit of mind, their destiny
in the world, are like those of the Romans, altogether practical; and
who can be surprised if they do not think about what they are not called
upon to think about?</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is quite a mistake to suppose that mysticism is
by its own nature unpractical.&nbsp; The greatest and most prosperous
races of antiquity&mdash;the Egyptians, Babylonians, Hindoos, Greeks&mdash;had
the mystic element as strong and living in them as the Germans have
now; and certainly we cannot call them unpractical peoples.&nbsp; They
fell and came to ruin&mdash;as the Germans may do&mdash;when their mysticism
became unpractical: but their thought remained, to be translated into
practice by sounder-hearted races than themselves.&nbsp; Rome learnt
from Greece, and did in some confused imperfect way that which Greece
only dreamed; just as future nations may act hereafter, nobly and usefully,
on the truths which Germans discover, only to put in a book and smoke
over.&nbsp; For they are terribly practical people, these mystics, quiet
students and devotees as they may seem.&nbsp; They go, or seem to go,
down to the roots of things, after a way of their own; and lay foundations
on which&mdash;be they sound or unsound&mdash;those who come after them
cannot choose but build; as we are building now.&nbsp; For our forefathers
were mystics for generations; they were mystics in the forests of Germany
and in the dales of Norway; they were mystics in the convents and the
universities of the Middle Ages; they were mystics, all the deepest
and noblest minds of them, during the Elizabethan era.</p>
<p>Even now the few mystic writers of this island are exercising more
influence on thought than any other men, for good or for evil.&nbsp;
Coleridge and Alexander Knox have changed the minds, and with them the
acts, of thousands; and when they are accused of having originated,
unknowingly, the whole &ldquo;Tractarian&rdquo; movement, those who
have watched English thought carefully can only answer, that on the
confession of the elder Tractarians themselves, the allegation is true:
but that they originated a dozen other &ldquo;movements&rdquo; beside
in the most opposite directions, and that free-thinking Emersonians
will be as ready as Romish perverts and good plain English churchmen
to confess that the critical point of their life was determined by the
writings of the fakeer of Highgate.&nbsp; At this very time too, the
only real mystic of any genius who is writing and teaching is exercising
more practical influence, infusing more vigorous life into the minds
of thousands of men and women, than all the other teachers of England
put together; and has set rolling a ball which may in the next half
century gather into an avalanche, perhaps utterly different in form,
material, and direction, from all which he expects.</p>
<p>So much for mystics being unpractical.&nbsp; If we look faithfully
into the meaning of their name, we shall see why, for good or for evil,
they cannot be unpractical; why they, let them be the most self-absorbed
of recluses, are the very men who sow the seeds of great schools, great
national and political movements, even great religions.</p>
<p>A mystic&mdash;according to the Greek etymology&mdash;should signify
one who is initiated into mysteries, one whose eyes are opened to see
things which other people cannot see.&nbsp; And the true mystic in all
ages and countries, has believed that this was the case with him.&nbsp;
He believes that there is an invisible world as well as a visible one&mdash;so
do most men: but the mystic believes also that this same invisible world
is not merely a supernumerary one world more, over and above the earth
on which he lives, and the stars over his head, but that it is the cause
of them and the ground of them; that it was the cause of them at first,
and is the cause of them now, even to the budding of every flower, and
the falling of every pebble to the ground; and therefore, that having
been before this visible world, it will be after it, and endure just
as real, living, and eternal, though matter were annihilated to-morrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, on this showing, every Christian, nay, every religious
man, is a mystic; for he believes in an invisible world?&rdquo;&nbsp;
The answer is found in the plain fact, that good Christians here in
England do not think so themselves; that they dislike and dread mysticism;
would not understand it if it were preached to them; are more puzzled
by those utterances of St. John, which mystics have always claimed as
justifying their theories, than by any part of their bibles.&nbsp; There
is a positive and conscious difference between popular metaphysics and
mysticism; and it seems to lie in this: the invisible world in which
Englishmen in general believe, is one which happens to be invisible
now, but which will not be so hereafter.&nbsp; When they speak of the
other world they mean a place which their bodily eyes will see some
day, and could see now if they were allowed; when they speak of spirits
they mean ghosts who could, and perhaps do, make themselves visible
to men&rsquo;s bodily eyes.&nbsp; We are not inquiring here whether
they be right or wrong; we are only specifying a common form of human
thought.</p>
<p>The mystic, on the other hand, believes that the invisible world
is so by its very nature, and must be so for ever.&nbsp; He lives therein
now, he holds, and will live in it through eternity: but he will see
it never with any bodily eyes, not even with the eyes of any future
&ldquo;glorified&rdquo; body.&nbsp; It is ipso facto not to be seen,
only to be believed in; never for him will &ldquo;faith be changed for
sight,&rdquo; as the popular theologians say that it will; for this
invisible world is only to be &ldquo;spiritually discerned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is the mystic idea, pure and simple; of course there are various
grades of it, as there are of the popular one; for no man holds his
own creed and nothing more; and it is good for him, in this piecemeal
and shortsighted world, that he should not.&nbsp; Were he over-true
to his own idea, he would become a fanatic, perhaps a madman.&nbsp;
And so the modern evangelical of the Venn and Newton school, to whom
mysticism is neology and nehushtan, when he speaks of &ldquo;spiritual
experiences,&rdquo; uses the adjective in its purely mystic sense; while
Bernard of Cluny, in his once famous hymn, &ldquo;Hic breve vivitur,&rdquo;
mingles the two conceptions of the unseen world in inextricable confusion.&nbsp;
Between these two extreme poles, in fact, we have every variety of thought;
and it is good for us that we should have them; for no one man or school
of men can grasp the whole truth, and every intermediate modification
supplies some link in the great cycle of facts which its neighbours
have overlooked.</p>
<p>In the minds who have held this belief, that the unseen world is
the only real and eternal one, there has generally existed a belief,
more or less confused, that the visible world is in some mysterious
way a pattern or symbol of the invisible one; that its physical laws
are the analogues of the spiritual laws of the eternal world: a belief
of which Mr. Vaughan seems to think lightly; though if it be untrue
we can hardly see how that metaphoric illustration in which he indulges
so freely, and which he often uses in a masterly and graceful way, can
be anything but useless trifling.&nbsp; For what is a metaphor or a
simile but a mere paralogism&mdash;having nothing to do with the matter
in hand, and not to be allowed for a moment to influence the reader&rsquo;s
judgment, unless there be some real and objective analogy&mdash;homology
we should call it&mdash;between the physical phenomenon from which the
symbol is taken, and the spiritual truth which it is meant to illustrate?&nbsp;
What divineness, what logical weight, in our Lord&rsquo;s parables,
unless He was by them trying to show his hearers that the laws which
they saw at work in the lilies of the field, in the most common occupations
of men, were but lower manifestations of the laws by which are governed
the inmost workings of the human spirit?&nbsp; What triflers, on any
other ground, were Socrates and Plato.&nbsp; What triflers, too, Shakespeare
and Spenser.&nbsp; Indeed, we should say that it is the belief, conscious
or unconscious, of the eternal correlation of the physical and spiritual
worlds, which alone constitutes the essence of a poet.</p>
<p>Of course this idea led, and would necessarily lead, to follies and
fancies enough, as long as the phenomena of nature were not carefully
studied, and her laws scientifically investigated; and all the dreams
of Paracelsus or Van Helmont, Cardan or Crollius, Baptista Porta or
Behmen, are but the natural and pardonable errors of minds which, while
they felt deeply the sanctity and mystery of Nature, had no Baconian
philosophy to tell them what Nature actually was, and what she actually
said.&nbsp; But their idea lives still, and will live as long as the
belief in a one God lives.&nbsp; The physical and spiritual worlds cannot
be separated by an impassable gulf.&nbsp; They must, in some way or
other, reflect each other, even in their minutest phenomena, for so
only can they both reflect that absolute primeval unity, in whom they
both live and move and have their being.&nbsp; Mr. Vaughan&rsquo;s object,
however, has not been to work out in his book such problems as these.&nbsp;
Had he done so, he would have made his readers understand better what
Mysticism is; he would have avoided several hasty epithets, by the use
of which he has, we think, deceived himself into the notion that he
has settled a matter by calling it a hard name; he would have explained,
perhaps, to himself and to us, many strange and seemingly contradictory
facts in the annals of Mysticism.&nbsp; But he would also not have written
so readable a book.&nbsp; On the whole he has taken the right course,
though one wishes that he had carried it out more methodically.</p>
<p>A few friends, literate and comfortable men, and right-hearted Christians
withal, meet together to talk over these same mystics, and to read papers
and extracts which will give a general notion of the subject from the
earliest historic times.&nbsp; The gentlemen talk about and about a
little too much; they are a little too fond of illustrations of the
popular pulpit style; they are often apt to say each his say, with very
little care of what the previous speaker has uttered; in fact these
conversations are, as conversations, not good, but as centres of thought
they are excellent.&nbsp; There is not a page nor a paragraph in which
there is not something well worth recollecting, and often reflections
very wise and weighty indeed, which show that whether or not Mr. Vaughan
has thoroughly grasped the subject of Mysticism, he has grasped and
made part of his own mind and heart many things far more practically
important than Mysticism, or any other form of thought; and no one ought
to rise up from the perusal of his book without finding himself if not
a better, at least a more thoughtful man, and perhaps a humble one also,
as he learns how many more struggles and doubts, discoveries, sorrows
and joys, the human race has passed through, than are contained in his
own private experience.</p>
<p>The true value of the book is, that though not exhaustive of the
subject, it is suggestive.&nbsp; It affords the best, indeed the only
general, sketch of the subject which we have in England, and gives therein
boundless food for future thought and reading; and the country parson,
or the thoughtful professional man, who has no time to follow out the
question for himself, much less to hunt out and examine original documents,
may learn from these pages a thousand curious and interesting hints
about men of like passions with himself, and about old times, the history
of which&mdash;as of all times&mdash;was not the history of their kings
and queens, but of the creeds and deeds of the &ldquo;masses&rdquo;
who worked, and failed, and sorrowed, and rejoiced again, unknown to
fame.&nbsp; Whatsoever, meanwhile, their own conclusions may be on the
subject-matter of the book, they will hardly fail to admire the extraordinary
variety and fulness of Mr. Vaughan&rsquo;s reading, and wonder when
they hear&mdash;unless we are wrongly informed&mdash;that he is quite
a young man&mdash;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>How one small head could compass all he knew.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>He begins with the mysticism of the Hindoo Yogis.&nbsp; And to this,
as we shall hereafter show, he hardly does justice; but we wish now
to point out in detail the extended range of subjects, of each of which
the book gives some general notion.&nbsp; From the Hindoos he passes
to Philo and the neo-Platonists; from them to the pseudo-Dionysius,
and the Mysticism of the early Eastern Church.&nbsp; He then traces,
shrewdly enough, the influence of the pseudo-Areopagite and the Easterns
on the bolder and more practical minds of the Western Latins, and gives
a sketch of Bernard and his Abbey of Clairvaux, which brings pleasantly
enough before us the ways and works of a long-dead world, which was
all but inconceivable to us till Mr, Carlyle disinterred it in his picture
of Abbot Sampson, the hero of &ldquo;Past and Present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We are next introduced to the mystic schoolmen&mdash;Hugo and Richard
of St. Victor; and then to a far more interesting class of men, and
one with which Mr. Vaughan has more sympathy than with any of his characters,
perhaps because he knows more about them.&nbsp; His chapters on the
German Mysticism of the fourteenth century; his imaginary, yet fruitful
chronicle of Adolf of Arnstein, with its glimpses of Meister Eckart,
Suso, the &ldquo;Nameless Wild,&rdquo; Ruysbroek, and Tauler himself,
are admirable, if merely as historic studies, and should be, and we
doubt not will be, read by many as practical commentaries on the &ldquo;Theologia
Germanica,&rdquo; and on the selection from Tauler&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sermons,&rdquo;
now in course of publication.&nbsp; Had all the book been written as
these chapters are, we should not have had a word of complaint to make,
save when we find the author passing over without a word of comment,
utterances which, right or wrong, contain the very keynote and central
idea of the men whom he is holding up to admiration, and as we think,
of Mysticism itself.&nbsp; There is, for instance, a paragraph attributed
to Ruysbroek, in p. 275, vol. i., which, whether true or false&mdash;and
we believe it to be essentially true&mdash;is so inexpressibly important,
both in the subject which it treats, and in the way in which it treats
it, that twenty pages of comment on it would not have been misdevoted.&nbsp;
Yet it is passed by without a word.</p>
<p>Going forward to the age of the Reformation, the book then gives
us a spirited glimpse of John Bokelson and the Munster Anabaptists,
of Carlstadt and the Zurichian prophets, and then dwells at some length
on the attempt of that day to combine physical and spiritual science
in occult philosophy.&nbsp; We have enough to make us wish to hear more
of Cornelius Agrippa, Paracelsus, and Behmen, with their alchemy, &ldquo;true
magic,&rdquo; doctrines of sympathies, <a name="citation309"></a><a href="#footnote309">{309}</a>
signatures of things, Cabbala, and Gamahea, and the rest of that (now
fallen) inverted pyramid of pseudo-science.&nbsp; His estimate of Behmen
and his writings, we may observe in passing, is both sound and charitable,
and speaks as much for Mr. Vaughan&rsquo;s heart as for his head.&nbsp;
Then we have a little about the Rosicrucians and the Comte de Gabalis,
and the theory of the Rabbis, from whom the Rosicrucians borrowed so
much, all told in the same lively manner, all utterly new to ninety-nine
readers out of a hundred, all indicating, we are bound to say, a much
more extensive reading than appears on the page itself.</p>
<p>From these he passes to the Mysticism of the counter-Reformation,
especially to the two great Spanish mystics, St. Theresa and St. John
of the Cross.&nbsp; Here again he is new and interesting; but we must
regret that he has not been as merciful to Theresa as he has to poor
little John.</p>
<p>He then devotes some eighty pages&mdash;and very well employed they
are&mdash;in detailing the strange and sad story of Madame Guyon and
the &ldquo;Quietist&rdquo; movement at Louis Quatorze&rsquo;s Court.&nbsp;
Much of this he has taken, with all due acknowledgment, from Upham;
but he has told the story most pleasantly, in his own way, and these
pages will give a better notion of F&eacute;nelon, and of the &ldquo;Eagle&rdquo;
(for eagle read vulture) &ldquo;of Meaux,&rdquo; old Bossuet, than they
are likely to find elsewhere in the same compass.</p>
<p>Following chronological order as nearly as he can, he next passes
to George Fox and the early Quakers, introducing a curious&mdash;and
in our own case quite novel&mdash;little episode concerning &ldquo;The
History of Hai Ebn Yokhdan,&rdquo; a medieval Arabian romance, which
old Barclay seems to have got hold of and pressed into the service of
his sect, taking it for literal truth.</p>
<p>The twelfth book is devoted to Swedenborg, and a very valuable little
sketch it is, and one which goes far to clear up the moral character,
and the reputation for sanity also, of that much-calumniated philosopher,
whom the world knows only as a dreaming false prophet, forgetting that
even if he was that, he was also a sound and severe scientific labourer,
to whom our modern physical science is most deeply indebted.</p>
<p>This is a short sketch of the contents of a book which is a really
valuable addition to English literature, and which is as interesting
as it is instructive.&nbsp; But Mr. Vaughan must forgive us if we tell
him frankly that he has not exhausted the subject; that he has hardly
defined Mysticism at all&mdash;at least, has defined it by its outward
results, and that without classifying them; and that he has not grasped
the central idea of the subject.&nbsp; There were more things in these
same mystics than are dreamt of in his philosophy; and he has missed
seeing them, because he has put himself rather in the attitude of a
judge than of an inquirer.</p>
<p>He has not had respect and trust enough for the men and women of
whom he writes; and is too much inclined to laugh at them, and treat
them <i>de haut en bas</i>.&nbsp; He has trusted too much to his own
great power of logical analysis, and his equally great power of illustration,
and is therefore apt to mistake the being able to put a man&rsquo;s
thoughts into words for him, for the being really able to understand
him.&nbsp; To understand any man we must have sympathy for him, even
affection.&nbsp; No intellectual acuteness, no amount even of mere pity
for his errors, will enable us to see the man from within, and put our
own souls into the place of his soul.&nbsp; To do that, one must feel
and confess within oneself the seed of the same errors which one reproves
in him; one must have passed more or less through his temptations, doubts,
hunger of heart and brain; and one cannot help questioning, as one reads
Mr. Vaughan&rsquo;s book, whether he has really done this in the case
of those of whom he writes.&nbsp; He should have remembered too how
little any young man can have experienced of the terrible sorrows which
branded into the hearts of these old devotees the truths to which they
clung more than to life, while they too often warped their hearts into
morbidity, and caused alike their folly and their wisdom.&nbsp; Gently
indeed should we speak even of the dreams of some self-imagined &ldquo;Bride
of Christ,&rdquo; when we picture to ourselves the bitter agonies which
must have been endured ere a human soul could develop so fantastically
diseased a growth.&nbsp; &ldquo;She was only a hysterical nun.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Well, and what more tragical object, to those who will look patiently
and lovingly at human nature, than a hysterical nun?&nbsp; She may have
been driven into a convent by some disappointment in love.&nbsp; And
has not disappointed affection been confessed, in all climes and ages,
to enshroud its victim ever after in a sanctuary of reverent pity?&nbsp;
If sorrow &ldquo;broke her brains,&rdquo; as well as broke her heart,
shall we do aught but love her the more for her capacity of love?&nbsp;
Or she may have entered the convent, as thousands did, in girlish simplicity,
to escape from a world she had not tried, before she had discovered
that the world could give her something which the convent could not.&nbsp;
What more tragical than her discovery in herself of a capacity for love
which could never be satisfied within that prison?&nbsp; And when that
capacity began to vindicate itself in strange forms of disease, seemingly
to her supernatural, often agonising, often degrading, and at the same
time (strange contradiction) mixed itself up with her noblest thoughts,
to ennoble them still more, and inspire her not only with a desire of
physical self-torture, which would seem holy both in her own eyes and
her priest&rsquo;s, but with a love for all that is fair and lofty,
for self-devotion and self-sacrifice&mdash;shall we blame her&mdash;shall
we even smile at her if, after the dreadful question: &ldquo;Is this
the possession of a demon?&rdquo; had alternated with, &ldquo;Is this
the inspiration of a god?&rdquo; she settled down, as the only escape
from madness and suicide, into the latter thought and believed that
she found in the ideal and perfect manhood of One whom she was told
to revere and love as a God, and who had sacrificed His own life for
her, a substitute for that merely human affection from which she was
for ever debarred?&nbsp; Why blame her for not numbering that which
was wanting, or making straight that which was crooked?&nbsp; Let God
judge her, not we: and the fit critics of her conduct are not the easy
gentlemanlike scholars, like Mr. Vaughan&rsquo;s Athertons and Gowers,
discussing the &ldquo;aberrations of fanaticism&rdquo; over wine and
walnuts; or the gay girl, Kate; hardly even the happy mother, Mrs. Atherton;
but those whose hairs are gray with sorrow; who have been softened at
once and hardened in the fire of God; who have cried out of the bottomless
deep like David, while lover and friend were hid away from them, and
laid amid the corpses of their dead hopes, dead health, dead joy, as
on a ghastly battle-field, &ldquo;stript among the dead, like those
who are wounded, and cut away from God&rsquo;s hands;&rdquo; who have
struggled drowning in the horrible mire of doubt, and have felt all
God&rsquo;s billows and waves sweep over them, till they were weary
of crying, and their sight failed for waiting so long upon God; and
all the faith and prayer which was left was &ldquo;Thou wilt not leave
my soul in hell, nor suffer thy Holy One to see corruption.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Be it understood, however, for fear of any mistake, that we hold Mr.
Vaughan to be simply and altogether right in his main idea.&nbsp; His
one test for all these people, and all which they said or did, is&mdash;Were
they made practically better men and women thereby?&nbsp; He sees clearly
that the &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; is none other than the &ldquo;moral&rdquo;&mdash;that
which has to do with right and wrong; and he has a righteous contempt
for everything and anything, however graceful and reverent, and artistic
and devout, and celestial and super-celestial, except in as far as he
finds it making better men and women do better work at every-day life.</p>
<p>But even on this ground we must protest against such a sketch as
this; even of one of the least honourable of the Middle-age saints:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>ATHERTON.&nbsp; Angela de Foligni, who made herself miserable&mdash;I
must say something the converse of flourished&mdash;about the beginning
of the fourteenth century, was a fine model pupil of this sort, a genuine
daughter of St. Francis.&nbsp; Her mother, her husband, her children
dead, she is alone and sorrowful.&nbsp; She betakes herself to violent
devotion&mdash;falls ill&mdash;suffers incessant anguish from a complication
of disorders&mdash;has rapturous consolations and terrific temptations&mdash;is
dashed in a moment from a seat of glory above the empyrean . . .</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Very amusing, is it not?&nbsp; To have one&rsquo;s mother, husband,
children die&mdash;the most commonplace sort of things&mdash;what (over
one&rsquo;s wine and walnuts) one describes as being &ldquo;alone and
sorrowful.&rdquo;&nbsp; Men who having tasted the blessings conveyed
in those few words, have also found the horror conveyed in them, have
no epithets for the state of mind in which such a fate would leave them.&nbsp;
They simply pray that if that hour came, they might just have faith
enough left not to curse God and die.&nbsp; Amusing, too, her falling
ill, and suffering under a complication of disorders, especially if
those disorders were the fruit of combined grief and widowhood.&nbsp;
Amusing also her betaking herself to violent devotion!&nbsp; In the
first place, if devotion be a good thing, could she have too much of
it?&nbsp; If it be the way to make people good (as is commonly held
by all Christian sects), could she become too good?&nbsp; The more important
question which springs out of the fact we will ask presently.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She has rapturous consolations and terrific temptations.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Did the consolations come first, and were the temptations a revulsion
from &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; exaltation into &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo;
collapse and melancholy? or did the temptations come first, and the
consolations come after, to save her from madness and despair?&nbsp;
Either may be the case; perhaps both were: but somewhat more of care
should have been taken in expressing so important a spiritual sequence
as either case exhibits.</p>
<p>It is twelve years and more since we studied the history of the &ldquo;B.
Angela de Foligni,&rdquo; and many another kindred saint; and we cannot
recollect what were the terrific temptations, what was the floor of
hell which the poor thing saw yawning beneath her feet.&nbsp; But we
must ask Mr. Vaughan, has he ever read Boccaccio, or any of the Italian
novelists up to the seventeenth century?&nbsp; And if so, can he not
understand how Angela de Foligni, the lovely Italian widow of the fourteenth
century, had her terrific temptations, to which, if she had yielded,
she might have fallen to the lowest pit of hell, let that word mean
what it may; and temptations all the more terrific because she saw every
widow round her considering them no temptations at all, but yielding
to them, going out to invite them in the most business-like, nay, duty-like,
way?&nbsp; What if she had &ldquo;rapturous consolations&rdquo;?&nbsp;
What if she did pour out to One who was worthy not of less but of more
affection than she offered in her passionate southern heart, in language
which in our colder northerns would be mere hypocrisy, yet which she
had been taught to believe lawful by that interpretation of the Canticles
which (be it always remembered) is common to Evangelicals and to Romanists?&nbsp;
What if even, in reward for her righteous belief, that what she saw
all widows round her doing was abominable and to be avoided at all risks,
she were permitted to enjoy a passionate affection, which after all
was not misplaced?&nbsp; There are mysteries in religion as in all things,
where it is better not to intrude behind the veil.&nbsp; Wisdom is justified
of all her children: and folly may be justified of some of her children
also.</p>
<p>Equally unfair it seems to us is the notice of St. Brigitta&mdash;in
our eyes a beautiful and noble figure.&nbsp; A widow she, too&mdash;and
what worlds of sorrow are there in that word, especially when applied
to the pure deep-hearted Northern woman, as she was&mdash;she leaves
her Scandinavian pine-forests to worship and to give wherever she can,
till she arrives at Rome, the centre of the universe, the seat of Christ&rsquo;s
vicegerent, the city of God, the gate of Paradise.&nbsp; Thousands of
weary miles she travels, through danger and sorrow&mdash;and when she
finds it, behold it is a lie and a sham! not the gate of Paradise, but
the gate of Sodom and of hell.&nbsp; Was not that enough to madden her,
if mad she became?&nbsp; What matter after that her &ldquo;angel dictated
discourses on the Blessed Virgin,&rdquo; &ldquo;bombastic invocations
to the Saviour&rsquo;s eyes, ears, hair?&rdquo;&mdash;they were at least
the best objects of worship which the age gave her.&nbsp; In one thing
she was right, and kept her first love.&nbsp; &ldquo;What was not quite
so bad, she gives to the world a series of revelations, in which the
vices of popes and prelates are lashed unsparingly and threatened with
speedy judgment.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not quite so bad?&nbsp; To us the whole
phenomenon wears an utterly different aspect.&nbsp; At the risk of her
life, at the risk of being burned alive&mdash;did anyone ever consider
what that means?&mdash;the noble Norse-woman, like an Alruna maid of
old, hurls out her divine hereditary hatred of sin and filth and lies.&nbsp;
At last she falls back on Christ Himself, as the only home for a homeless
soul in such an evil time.&nbsp; And she is not burnt alive.&nbsp; The
hand of One mightier than she is over her, and she is safe under the
shadow of His wings till her weary work is done and she goes home, her
righteousness accepted for His sake: her folly, hysterics, dreams&mdash;call
them by what base name we will&mdash;forgiven and forgotten for the
sake of her many sorrows and her faithfulness to the end.</p>
<p>But whatever fault we can find with these sketches, we can find none
with Mr. Vaughan&rsquo;s reflections on them:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>What a condemning comment on the pretended tender mercies of the
Church are those narratives which Rome delights to parade of the sufferings,
mental and bodily, which her devotees were instructed to inflict upon
themselves!&nbsp; I am reminded of the thirsting mule, which has, in
some countries, to strike with his hoof among the spines of the cactus,
and drink, with lamed foot and bleeding lips, the few drops of milk
which ooze from the broken thorns.&nbsp; Affectionate, suffering natures
came to Rome for comfort; but her scanty kindness is only to be drawn
with anguish from the cruel sharpness of asceticism.&nbsp; The worldly,
the audacious, escape easily; but these pliant excitable temperaments,
so anxiously in earnest, may be made useful.&nbsp; The more dangerous,
frightful, or unnatural their performances, the more profit for their
keepers.&nbsp; Men and women are trained by torturing processes to deny
their nature, and then they are exhibited to bring grist to the mill&mdash;like
birds and beasts forced to postures and services against the laws of
their being&mdash;like those who must perform perilous feats on ropes
or with lions, nightly hazarding their lives to fill the pockets of
a manager.&nbsp; The self-devotedness of which Rome boasts so much is
a self-devotion she has always thus made the most of for herself.&nbsp;
Calculating men who have thought only of the interest of the priesthood,
have known well how best to stimulate and to display the spasmodic movements
of a brainsick disinterestedness.&nbsp; I have not the shadow of a doubt
that, once and again, some priest might have been seen, with cold gray
eye, endeavouring to do a stroke of diplomacy by means of the enthusiastic
Catherine, making the fancied ambassadress of Heaven in reality the
tool of a schemer.&nbsp; Such unquestionable virtues as these visionaries
may some of them have possessed cannot be fairly set down to the credit
of the Church, which has used them all for mercenary or ambitious purposes,
and infected them everywhere with a morbid character.&nbsp; Some of
these mystics, floating down the great ecclesiastical current of the
Middle Age, appear to me like the trees carried away by the inundation
of some mighty tropical river.&nbsp; They drift along the stream, passive,
lifeless, broken; yet they are covered with gay verdure, the aquatic
plants hang and twine about the sodden timber and the draggled leaves,
the trunk is a sailing garden of flowers.&nbsp; But the adornment is
that of Nature&mdash;it is the decoration of another and a strange element:
the roots are in the air; the boughs which should be full of birds,
are in the flood, covered by its alien products, swimming side by side
with the alligator.&nbsp; So has this priestcraft swept its victims
from their natural place and independent growth, to clothe them in their
helplessness with a false spiritual adornment, neither scriptural nor
human, but ecclesiastical&mdash;the native product of that overwhelming
superstition which has subverted and enslaved their nature.&nbsp; The
Church of Rome takes care that while simple souls think they are cultivating
Christian graces they shall be forging their own chains; that their
attempts to honour God shall always dishonour, because they disenfranchise
themselves.&nbsp; To be humble, to be obedient, to be charitable, under
such direction, is to be contentedly ignorant, pitiably abject, and
notoriously swindled.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Mr. Vaughan cannot be too severe upon the Romish priesthood.&nbsp;
But it is one thing to dismiss with summary contempt men, who, as they
do, keep the keys of knowledge, and neither enter in themselves nor
suffer others to enter, and quite another thing to apply the same summary
jurisdiction to men who, under whatsoever confusions, are feeling earnestly
and honestly after truth.&nbsp; And therefore we regret exceedingly
the mock trial which he has introduced into his Introduction.&nbsp;
We regret it for his own sake; for it will drive away from the book&mdash;indeed
it has driven&mdash;thoughtful and reverent people who, having a strong
though vague inclination toward the Mystics, might be very profitably
taught by the after pages to separate the evil from the good in the
Bernards and Guyons whom they admire, they scarce know why; and will
shock, too, scholars, to whom Hindoo and Persian thoughts on these subjects
are matters not of ridicule but of solemn and earnest investigation.</p>
<p>Besides, the question is not so easily settled.&nbsp; Putting aside
the flippancy of the passage, it involves something very like a petitio
principii to ask offhand: &ldquo;Does the man mean a living union of
heart to Christ, a spiritual fellowship or converse with the Father,
when he talks of the union of the believer with God&mdash;participation
in the Divine nature?&rdquo;&nbsp; For first, what we want to know is,
the meaning of the words&mdash;what means &ldquo;living&rdquo;? what
&ldquo;union&rdquo;? what &ldquo;heart&rdquo;?&nbsp; They are terms
common to the Mystic and to the popular religionist, only differently
interpreted; and in the meanings attributed to them lies nothing less
than the whole world-old dispute between Nominalist and Realist not
yet to be settled in two lines by two gentlemen over their wine, much
less ignored as a thing settled beyond all dispute already.&nbsp; If
by &ldquo;living union of heart with&rdquo;&mdash;Mr. Vaughan meant
&ldquo;identity of morals with&rdquo;&mdash;he should have said so:
but he should have borne in mind that all the great evangelicals have
meant much more than this by those words; that on the whole, instead
of considering&mdash;as he seems to do, and we do&mdash;the moral and
the spiritual as identical, they have put them in antithesis to each
other, and looked down upon &ldquo;mere morality&rdquo; just because
it did not seem to them to involve that supernatural, transcendental,
&ldquo;mystic&rdquo; element which they considered that they found in
Scripture.&nbsp; From Luther to Owen and Baxter, from them to Wesley,
Cecil, and Venn, Newton, Bridges, the great evangelical authorities
would (not very clearly or consistently, for they were but poor metaphysicians,
but honestly and earnestly) have accepted some modified form of the
Mystic&rsquo;s theory, even to the &ldquo;discerning in particular thoughts,
frames, impulses, and inward witnessings, immediate communications from
heaven.&rdquo;&nbsp; Surely Mr. Vaughan must be aware that the majority
of &ldquo;vital Christians&rdquo; on this ground are among his mystic
offenders; and that those who deny such possibilities are but too liable
to be stigmatised as &ldquo;Pelagians,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Rationalists.&rdquo;&nbsp;
His friend Atherton is bound to show cause why those names are not to
be applied to him, as he is bound to show what he means by &ldquo;living
union with Christ,&rdquo; and why he complains of the Mystic for desiring
&ldquo;participation in the Divine nature.&rdquo;&nbsp; If he does so,
he only desires what the New Testament formally, and word for word,
promises him; whatsoever be the meaning of the term, he is not to be
blamed for using it.&nbsp; Mr. Vaughan cannot have forgotten the many
expressions, both of St. Paul and St. John, which do at first sight
go far to justify the Mystic, though they are but seldom heard, and
more seldom boldly commented on, in modern pulpits&mdash;of Christ being
formed in men, dwelling in men; of God dwelling in man and man in God;
of Christ being the life of men; of men living, and moving, and having
their being in God; and many another passage.&nbsp; If these be mere
metaphors let the fact be stated, with due reason for it.&nbsp; But
there is no sin or shame in interpreting them in that literal and realist
sense in which they seem at first sight to have been written.&nbsp;
The first duty of a scholar who sets before himself to investigate the
phenomena of &ldquo;Mysticism&rdquo; so called, should be to answer
these questions: Can there be a direct communication, above and beyond
sense or consciousness, between the human spirit and God the Spirit?&nbsp;
And if so, what are its conditions, where its limits, to transcend which
is to fall into &ldquo;mysticism&rdquo;?</p>
<p>And it is just this which Mr. Vaughan fails in doing.&nbsp; In his
sketch, for instance, of the Mysticism of India, he gives us a very
clear and (save in two points) sound summary of that &ldquo;round of
notions, occurring to minds of similar make under similar circumstances,&rdquo;
which is &ldquo;common to Mystics in ancient India and in modern Christendom.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Summarily, I would say this Hindoo mysticism&mdash;</p>
<p>(1)&nbsp; Lays claim to disinterested love as opposed to a mercenary
religion;</p>
<p>(2)&nbsp; Reacts against the ceremonial prescription and pedantic
literalism of the Vedas;</p>
<p>(3)&nbsp; Identifies, in its pantheism, subject and object, worshipper
and worshipped;</p>
<p>(4)&nbsp; Aims at ultimate absorption in the Infinite;</p>
<p>(5)&nbsp; Inculcates, as the way to this dissolution, absolute passivity,
withdrawal into the inmost self, cessation of all the powers: giving
recipes for procuring this beatific torpor or trance;</p>
<p>(6)&nbsp; Believes that eternity may thus be realised in time;</p>
<p>(7)&nbsp; Has its mythical miraculous pretensions, <i>i.e</i>. its
theurgic department;</p>
<p>(8)&nbsp; And, finally, advises the learner in this kind of religion
to submit himself implicitly to a spiritual guide&mdash;his Guru.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Against the two latter articles we except.&nbsp; The theurgic department
of Mysticism&mdash;unfortunately but too common&mdash;seems to us always
to have been (as it certainly was in neo-Platonism) the despairing return
to that ceremonialism which it had begun by shaking off, when it was
disappointed in reaching its high aim by its proper method.&nbsp; The
use of the Guru, or Father Confessor (which Mr. Vaughan confesses to
be inconsistent with Mysticism), is to be explained in the same way&mdash;he
is a last refuge after disappointment.</p>
<p>But as for the first six counts.&nbsp; Is the Hindoo mystic a worse
or a better man for holding them?&nbsp; Are they on the whole right
or wrong?&nbsp; Is not disinterested love nobler than a mercenary religion?&nbsp;
Is it not right to protest against ceremonial prescriptions, and to
say, with the later prophets and psalmists of the Jews: &ldquo;Thinkest
thou that He will eat bull&rsquo;s flesh, and drink the blood of goats.&nbsp;
Sacrifice and burnt-offering Thou wouldst not . . . I come to do thy
will, O God!&rdquo;&nbsp; What is, even, if he will look calmly into
it, the &ldquo;pantheistic identification of subject and object, worshipper
and worshipped,&rdquo; but the clumsy yet honest effort of the human
mind to say to itself: &ldquo;Doing God&rsquo;s will is the real end
and aim of man?&rdquo;&nbsp; The Yogi looks round upon his fellow-men,
and sees that all their misery and shame come from self-will; he looks
within, and finds that all which makes him miserable, angry, lustful,
greedy after this and that, comes from the same self-will.&nbsp; And
he asks himself: How shall I escape from this torment of self?&mdash;how
shall I tame my wayward will, till it shall become one with the harmonious,
beautiful, and absolute Will which made all things?&nbsp; At least I
will try to do it, whatever it shall cost me.&nbsp; I will give up all
for which men live&mdash;wife and child, the sights, scents, sounds
of this fair earth, all things, whatever they be, which men call enjoyment;
I will make this life one long torture, if need be; but this rebel will
of mine I will conquer.&nbsp; I ask for no reward.&nbsp; That may come
in some future life.&nbsp; But what care I?&nbsp; I am now miserable
by reason of the lusts which war in my members; the peace which I shall
gain in being freed from them will be its own reward.&nbsp; After all
I give up little.&nbsp; All those things round me&mdash;the primeval
forest, and the sacred stream of Ganga, the mighty Himalaya, mount of
God, ay, the illimitable vault of heaven above me, sun and stars&mdash;what
are they but &ldquo;such stuff as dreams are made of&rdquo;?&nbsp; Brahm
thought, and they became something and somewhere.&nbsp; He may think
again, and they will become nothing and nowhere.&nbsp; Are these eternal,
greater than I, worth troubling my mind about?&nbsp; Nothing is eternal,
but the Thought which made them, and will unmake them.&nbsp; They are
only venerable in my eyes, because each of them is a thought of Brahm&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
And I too have thought; I alone of all the kinds of living things.&nbsp;
Am I not, then, akin to God? what better for me than to sit down and
think, as Brahm thinks, and so enjoy my eternal heritage, leaving for
those who cannot think the passions and pleasures which they share in
common with the beasts of the field?&nbsp; So I shall become more and
more like Brahm&mdash;will his will, think his thoughts, till I lose
utterly this house-fiend of self, and become one with God.</p>
<p>Is this a man to be despised?&nbsp; Is he a sickly dreamer, or a
too valiant hero? and if any one be shocked at this last utterance,
let him consider carefully the words which he may hear on Sunday: &ldquo;Then
we dwell in Christ, and Christ in us; we are one with Christ, and Christ
with us.&rdquo;&nbsp; That belief is surely not a false one.&nbsp; Shall
we abhor the Yogi because he has seen, sitting alone there amid idolatry
and licentiousness, despotism and priestcraft, that the ideal goal of
man is what we confess it to be in the communion service?&nbsp; Shall
we not rather wonder and rejoice over the magnificent utterance in that
Bhagavat-Gita which Mr. Vaughan takes for the text-book of Hindoo Mysticism,
where Krishna, the teacher human, and yet God himself, speaks thus:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>There is nothing greater than I; all things hang on me, as precious
gems upon a string. . . . . I am life in all things, and zeal in the
zealous.&nbsp; I am the eternal seed of nature: I am the understanding
of the wise, the glory of the proud, the strength of the strong, free
from lust and anger. . . .&nbsp; Those who trust in me know Brahm, the
supreme and incorruptible. . . . . In this body I am the teacher of
worship.&nbsp; He who thinks of me will find me.&nbsp; He who finds
me returns not again to mortal birth. . . . . I am the sacrifice, I
am the worship, I am the incense, I am the fire, I am the victim, I
am the father and mother of the world; I am the road of the good, the
comforter, the creator, the witness, the asylum, and the friend.&nbsp;
They who serve other Gods with a firm belief, involuntarily worship
me.&nbsp; I am the same to all mankind.&nbsp; They who serve me in adoration
are in me.&nbsp; If one whose ways are ever so evil serve me alone,
he becometh of a virtuous spirit and obtaineth eternal happiness.&nbsp;
Even women, and the tribes of Visya and Soodra, shall go the supreme
journey if they take sanctuary with me; how much more my holy servants
the Brahmins and the Ragarshees!&nbsp; Consider this world as a finite
and joyless place, and serve me.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>There may be confused words scattered up and down here; there are
still more confused words&mdash;not immoral ones&mdash;round them, which
we have omitted; but we ask, once and for all, is this true, or is it
not?&nbsp; Is there a being who answers to this description, or is there
not?&nbsp; And if there be, was it not a light price to pay for the
discovery of Him &ldquo;to sit upon the sacred grass called koos, with
his mind fixed on one object alone; keeping his head, neck, and body
steady, without motion; his eyes fixed upon the point of his nose, looking
at no other place around&rdquo;&mdash;or any other simple, even childish,
practical means of getting rid of the disturbing bustle and noise of
the outward time-world, that he might see the eternal world which underlies
it?&nbsp; What if the discovery be imperfect, the figure in many features
erroneous?&nbsp; Is not the wonder to us, the honour to him, that the
figure should be there at all?&nbsp; Inexplicable to us on any ground,
save that one common to the Bhagavat-Gita, to the gospel.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
who seeks me shall find me.&rdquo;&nbsp; What if he knew but in part,
and saw through a glass darkly?&nbsp; Was there not an inspired apostle,
who could but say the very same thing of himself, and look forward to
a future life in which he would &ldquo;know even as he was known&rdquo;?</p>
<p>It is well worth observing too, that so far from the moral of this
Bhagavat-Gita issuing in mere contemplative Quietism, its purpose is
essentially practical.&nbsp; It arises out of Arjoun&rsquo;s doubt whether
he shall join in the battle which he sees raging below him; it results
in his being commanded to join in it, and fight like a man.&nbsp; We
cannot see, as Mr. Vaughan does, an &ldquo;unholy indifference&rdquo;
in the moral.&nbsp; Arjoun shrinks from fighting because friends and
relatives are engaged on both sides, and he dreads hell if he kills
one of them.&nbsp; The answer to his doubt is, after all, the only one
which makes war permissible to a Christian, who looks on all men as
his brothers:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a Ksahtree, a soldier; your duty is to fight.&nbsp;
Do your duty, and leave the consequences of it to him who commanded
the duty.&nbsp; You cannot kill these men&rsquo;s souls any more than
they can yours.&nbsp; You can only kill their mortal bodies; the fate
of their souls and yours depends on their moral state.&nbsp; Kill their
bodies, then, if it be your duty, instead of tormenting yourself with
scruples, which are not really scruples of conscience, only selfish
fears of harm to yourself, and leave their souls to the care of Him
who made them, and knows them, and cares more for them than you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This seems to be the plain outcome of the teaching.&nbsp; What is
it, mutatis mutandis, but the sermon &ldquo;cold-blooded&rdquo; or not,
which every righteous soldier has to preach to himself, day by day,
as long as his duty commands him to kill his human brothers?</p>
<p>Yet the fact is undeniable that Hindoo Mysticism has failed of practical
result&mdash;that it has died down into brutal fakeerism.&nbsp; We look
in vain, however, in Mr. Vaughan&rsquo;s chapter for an explanation
of this fact, save his assertion, which we deny, that Hindoo Mysticism
was in essence and at its root wrong and rotten.&nbsp; Mr. Maurice (&ldquo;Moral
and Metaphysical Philosophy,&rdquo; p. 46) seems to point to a more
charitable solution.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Hindoo,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;whatsoever
vast discovery he may have made at an early period of a mysterious Teacher
near him, working on his spirit, who is at the same time Lord over nature,
began the search from himself&mdash;he had no other point from whence
to begin&mdash;and therefore it ended in himself.&nbsp; The purification
of his individual soul became practically his highest conceivable end;
to carry out that he must separate from society.&nbsp; Yet the more
he tries to escape self the more he finds self; for what are his thoughts
about Brahm, his thoughts about Krishna, save his own thoughts?&nbsp;
Is Brahm a projection of his own soul?&nbsp; To sink in him, does it
mean to be nothing?&nbsp; Am I, after all, my own law?&nbsp; And hence
the downward career into stupid indifferentism, even into Antinomian
profligacy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Hebrew, on the other hand, begins from the belief of an objective
external God, but One who cares for more than his individual soul; as
One who is the ever-present guide, and teacher, and ruler of his whole
nation; who regards that nation as a whole, a one person, and that not
merely one present generation, but all, past or future, as a one &ldquo;Israel&rdquo;&mdash;lawgivers,
prophets, priests, warriors.&nbsp; All classes are His ministers.&nbsp;
He is essentially a political deity, who cares infinitely for the polity
of a nation, and therefore bestows one upon them&mdash;&ldquo;a law
of Jehovah.&rdquo;&nbsp; Gradually, under this teaching, the Hebrew
rises to the very idea of an inward teacher, which the Yogi had, and
to a far purer and clearer form of that idea; but he is not tempted
by it to selfish individualism, or contemplative isolation, as long
as he is true to the old Mosaic belief, that this being is the Political
Deity, &ldquo;the King of Kings.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Pharisee becomes a
selfish individualist just because he has forgotten this; the Essene,
a selfish &ldquo;mystic&rdquo; for the same reason; Philo and the Jewish
mystics of Alexandria lose in like manner all notion that Jehovah is
the lawgiver, and ruler, and archetype of family and of national life.&nbsp;
Christianity retained the idea; it brought out the meaning of the old
Jewish polity in its highest form; for that very reason it was able
to bring out the meaning of the &ldquo;mystic&rdquo; idea in its highest
form also, without injury to men&rsquo;s work as members of families,
as citizens, as practical men of the world; and so to conquer at last
that Manich&aelig;an hatred of marriage and parentage, which from the
first to the sixteenth century shed its Upas shade over the Church.</p>
<p>And here let us say boldly to Mr. Vaughan and to our readers: As
long as &ldquo;the salvation of a man&rsquo;s own soul&rdquo; is set
forth in all pulpits as the first and last end and aim of mortal existence;
as long as Christianity is dwelt on merely as influencing individuals
each apart&mdash;as &ldquo;brands plucked, one here and another there,
from the general burning&rdquo;&mdash;so long will Mysticism, in its
highest form be the refuge of the strongest spirits, and in its more
base and diseased forms the refuge of the weak and sentimental spirits.&nbsp;
They will say, each in his own way: &ldquo;You confess that there can
be a direct relation, communion, inspiration, from God to my soul, as
I sit alone in my chamber.&nbsp; You do not think that there is such
between God and what you call the world; between Him and nations as
wholes&mdash;families, churches, schools of thought, as wholes; that
He does not take a special interest, or exercise a special influence,
over the ways and works of men&mdash;over science, commerce, civilisation,
colonisation, all which affects the earthly destinies of the race.&nbsp;
All these you call secular; to admit His influence over them for their
own sake (though of course He overrules them for the sake of His elect)
savours of Pantheism.&nbsp; Is it so?&nbsp; Then we will give up the
world.&nbsp; We will cling to the one fact which you confess to be certain
about us&mdash;that we can take refuge in God, each in the loneliness
of his chamber, from all the vain turmoil of a race which is hastening
heedless into endless misery.&nbsp; You may call us Mystics, or what
you will.&nbsp; We will possess our souls in patience, and turn away
our eyes from vanity.&nbsp; We will commune with our own hearts in solitude,
and be still.&nbsp; We will not even mingle in your religious world,
the world which you have invented for yourselves, after denying that
God&rsquo;s human world is sacred; for it seems to us as full of intrigue,
ambition, party-spirit, falsehood, bitterness, and ignorance, as the
political world, or the fashionable world, or the scientific world;
and we will have none of it.&nbsp; Leave us alone with God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This has been the true reason of mystical isolation in every age
and country.&nbsp; So thought Macarius and the Christian fakeers of
the Thebaid.&nbsp; So thought the medieval monks and nuns.&nbsp; So
thought the German Quietists when they revolted from the fierce degradation
of decaying Lutheranism.&nbsp; So are hundreds thinking now; so may
thousands think ere long.&nbsp; If the individualising phase of Christianity
which is now dominant shall long retain its ascendancy, and the creed
of Dr. Cumming and Mr. Spurgeon become that of the British people, our
purest and noblest spirits will act here, with regard to religion, as
the purest and noblest in America have acted with regard to politics.&nbsp;
They will withdraw each into the sanctuary of his own heart, and leave
the battle-field to rival demagogues.&nbsp; They will do wrong, it may
be.&nbsp; Isolation involves laziness, pride, cowardice; but if sober
England, during the next half-century, should be astonished by an outburst
of Mysticism, as grand in some respects, as fantastic in others, as
that of the thirteenth or the seventeenth centuries, the blame, if blame
there be, will lie with those leaders of the public conscience who,
after having debased alike the Church of England and the dissenting
sects with a selfish individualism which was as foreign to the old Cromwellite
Ironside as to the High Church divine, have tried to debar their disciples
from that peaceful and graceful Mysticism which is the only excusable
or tolerable form, of religion beginning and ending in self.</p>
<p>Let it be always borne in mind, that Quakerism was not a protest
against, or a revulsion from, the Church of England, but from Calvinism.&nbsp;
The steeple-houses, against which George Fox testified, were not served
by Henry Mores, Cudworths, or Norrises: not even by dogmatist High-Churchmen,
but by Calvinist ministers, who had ejected them.&nbsp; George Fox developed
his own scheme, such as it was, because the popular Protestantism of
his day failed to meet the deepest wants of his heart; because, as he
used to say, it gave him &ldquo;a dead Christ,&rdquo; and he required
&ldquo;a living Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; Doctrines about who Christ is,
he held, are not Christ Himself.&nbsp; Doctrines about what He has done
for man, are not He himself.&nbsp; Fox held, that if Christ be a living
person, He must act (when He acted) directly on the most inward and
central personality of him, George Fox; and his desire was satisfied
by the discovery of the indwelling Logos, or rather by its re-discovery,
after it had fallen into oblivion for centuries.&nbsp; Whether he were
right or wrong, he is a fresh instance of a man&rsquo;s arriving, alone
and unassisted, at the same idea at which Mystics of all ages and countries
have arrived: a fresh corroboration of our belief, that there must be
some reality corresponding to a notion which has manifested itself so
variously, and among so many thousands of every creed, and has yet arrived,
by whatsoever different paths, at one and the same result.</p>
<p>That he was more or less right&mdash;that there is nothing in the
essence of Mysticism contrary to practical morality, Mr. Vaughan himself
fully confesses.&nbsp; In his fair and liberal chapters on Fox and the
Early Quakers, he does full justice to their intense practical benevolence;
to the important fact that Fox only lived to do good, of any and every
kind, as often as a sorrow to be soothed, or an evil to be remedied,
crossed his path.&nbsp; We only wish that he had also brought in the
curious and affecting account of Fox&rsquo;s interview with Cromwell,
in which he tells us (and we will take Fox&rsquo;s word against any
man) that the Protector gave him to understand, almost with tears, that
there was that in Fox&rsquo;s faith which he was seeking in vain from
the &ldquo;ministers&rdquo; around him.</p>
<p>All we ask of Mr. Vaughan is, not to be afraid of his own evident
liking for Fox; of his own evident liking for Tauler and his school;
not to put aside the question which their doctrines involve, with such
half-utterances as&mdash;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>The Quakers are wrong, I think, in separating particular movements
and monitions as Divine.&nbsp; But, at the same time, the &ldquo;witness
of the Spirit,&rdquo; as regards our state before God, is something
more, I believe, than the mere attestation to the written word.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>As for the former of these two sentences, he may be quite right,
for aught we know.&nbsp; But it must be said on the other hand, that
not merely Quakers, but decent men of every creed and age, have&mdash;we
may dare to say, in proportion to their devoutness&mdash;believed in
such monitions; and that it is hard to see how any man could have arrived
at the belief that a living person was working on him, and not a mere
impersonal principle, law, or afflatus&mdash;(spirit of the universe,
or other metaphor for hiding materialism)&mdash;unless by believing,
rightly or wrongly, in such monitions.&nbsp; For our only inductive
conception of a living person demands that that person shall make himself
felt by separate acts.</p>
<p>But against the second sentence we must protest.&nbsp; The question
in hand is not whether this &ldquo;witness of the Spirit&rdquo; &ldquo;is
something more&rdquo; than, anything else, but whether it exists at
all, and what it is.&nbsp; Why was the book written, save to help toward
the solution of this very matter?&nbsp; The question all through has
been: Can an immediate influence be exercised by the Spirit of God on
the spirit of man?&nbsp; Mr. Vaughan assents, and says (we cannot see
why) that there is no mysticism in such a belief.&nbsp; Be that as it
may, what that influence is, and how exercised, is all through the de
quo agitur of Mysticism.&nbsp; Mr. Vaughan, however, seems here for
awhile to be talking realism through an admirable page, well worth perusal
(pp. 264, 265).&nbsp; Yet his grasp is not sure.&nbsp; We soon find
him saying what More and Fox would alike deny, that &ldquo;The story
of Christ&rsquo;s life and death is our soul&rsquo;s food.&rdquo;&nbsp;
No; Christ Himself is&mdash;would the Catholic Church and the Mystic
alike answer.&nbsp; And here again the whole matter in dispute is (unconsciously
to Mr. Vaughan) opened up in one word.&nbsp; And if this sentence does
not bear directly on that problem, on what does it bear?&nbsp; It was
therefore with extreme disappointment that on reading this, and saying
to ourselves: &ldquo;Now we shall hear at last what Mr. Vaughan himself
thinks on the matter,&rdquo; we found that he literally turned the subject
off, as if not worth investigation, by making the next speaker answer,
apropos of nothing, that &ldquo;the traditional ascetism of the Friends
is their fatal defect as a body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why, too, has Mr. Vaughan devoted a few lines only to the great English
Platonists, More, Norris, Smith of Jesus, Gale, and Cudworth?&nbsp;
He says, indeed, that they are scarcely Mystics, except in as far as
Platonism is always in a measure mystical.&nbsp; In our sense of the
word they were all of them Mystics, and of a very lofty type; but surely
Henry More is a Mystic in Mr. Vaughan&rsquo;s sense also.&nbsp; If the
author of &ldquo;Conjectura Cabbalistica&rdquo; be not a mystical writer
(he himself uses the term without shame), who is?</p>
<p>We hope to see much in this book condensed, much modified, much worked
out, instead of being left fragmentary and embryotic; but whether our
hope be fulfilled or not, a useful and honourable future is before the
man who could write such a book as this is, in spite of all defects.</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p>Since the above was written, Mr. Vaughan&rsquo;s premature death
has robbed us of a man who might have done brave work, by lessening,
through his own learning, the intellectual gulf which now exists between
English Churchmen and Dissenters.&nbsp; D&icirc;s aliter visum.&nbsp;
But Mr. Vaughan&rsquo;s death does not, I think, render it necessary
for me to alter any of the opinions expressed here; and least of all
that in the last sentence, fulfilled now more perfectly than I could
have foreseen.</p>

<h2>FREDERICK DENISON MAURICE. <a name="citation337"></a><a href="#footnote337">{337}</a>
IN MEMORIAM</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>On Friday, the fifth of April, a noteworthy assemblage gathered round
an open vault in a corner of Highgate Cemetery.&nbsp; Some hundreds
of persons, closely packed up the steep banks among the trees and shrubs,
had found in that grave a common bond of brotherhood.&nbsp; I say, in
that grave.&nbsp; They were no sect, clique, or school of disciples,
held together by community of opinions.&nbsp; They were simply men and
women, held together, for the moment at least, by love of a man, and
that man, as they had believed, a man of God.&nbsp; All shades of opinion,
almost of creed, were represented there; though the majority were members
of the Church of England&mdash;many probably reconciled to that Church
by him who lay below.&nbsp; All sorts and conditions of men, and indeed
of women, were there; for he had had a word for all sorts and conditions
of men.&nbsp; Most of them had never seen each other before&mdash;would
never see each other again.&nbsp; But each felt that the man, however
unknown to him who stood next him, was indeed a brother in loyalty to
that beautiful soul, beautiful face, beautiful smile, beautiful voice,
from which, in public or in secret, each had received noble impulses,
tender consolation, loving correction, and clearer and juster conceptions
of God, of duty, of the meaning of themselves and of the universe.&nbsp;
And when they turned and left his body there, the world&mdash;as one
said who served him gallantly and long&mdash;seemed darker now he had
left it; but he had stayed here long enough to do the work for which
he was fitted.&nbsp; He had wasted no time, but died, like a valiant
man, at his work, and of his work.</p>
<p>He might have been buried in Westminster Abbey.&nbsp; There was no
lack of men of mark who held that such a public recognition of his worth
was due, not only to the man himself, but to the honour of the Church
of England.&nbsp; His life had been one of rare sanctity; he was a philosopher
of learning and acuteness, unsurpassed by any man of his generation;
he had done more than any man of that generation to defend the Church&rsquo;s
doctrines; to recommend her to highly-cultivated men and women; to bring
within her pale those who had been born outside it, or had wandered
from it; to reconcile the revolutionary party among the workmen of the
great cities with Christianity, order, law; to make all ranks understand
that if Christianity meant anything, it meant that a man should not
merely strive to save his own soul after death, but that he should live
here the life of a true citizen, virtuous, earnest, helpful to his human
brethren.&nbsp; He had been the originator of, or at least the chief
mover in, working-men&rsquo;s colleges, schemes for the higher education
of women, for the protection of the weak and the oppressed.&nbsp; He
had been the champion, the organiser, the helper with his own money
and time, of that co-operative movement&mdash;the very germ of the economy
of the future&mdash;which seems now destined to spread, and with right
good results, to far other classes, and in far other forms, than those
of which Mr. Maurice was thinking five-and-twenty years ago.&nbsp; His
whole life had been one of unceasing labour for that which he believed
to be truth and right, and for the practical amelioration of his fellow-creatures.&nbsp;
He had not an enemy, unless it were here and there a bigot or a dishonest
man&mdash;two classes who could not abide him, because they knew well
that he could not abide them.&nbsp; But for the rest, those from whom
he had differed most, with whom he had engaged, ere now, in the sharpest
controversy, had learned to admire his sanctity, charity, courtesy&mdash;for
he was the most perfect of gentlemen&mdash;as well as to respect his
genius and learning.&nbsp; He had been welcomed to Cambridge, by all
the finer spirits of the University, as Professor of Moral Philosophy;
and as such, and as the parish priest of St. Edward&rsquo;s, he had
done his work&mdash;as far as failing health allowed&mdash;as none but
he could do it.&nbsp; Nothing save his own too-scrupulous sense of honour
had prevented him from accepting some higher ecclesiastical preferment&mdash;which
he would have used, alas! not for literary leisure, nor for the physical
rest which he absolutely required, but merely as an excuse for greater
and more arduous toil.&nbsp; If such a man was not the man whom the
Church of England would delight to honour, who was the man?&nbsp; But
he was gone; and a grave among England&rsquo;s worthies was all that
could be offered him now; and it was offered.&nbsp; But those whose
will on such a point was law, judged it to be more in keeping with the
exquisite modesty and humility of Frederick Denison Maurice, that he
should be laid out of sight, though not out of mind, by the side of
his father and his mother.&nbsp; Well: be it so.&nbsp; At least that
green nook at Highgate will be a sacred spot to hundreds&mdash;it may
be to thousands&mdash;who owe him more than they will care to tell to
any created being.</p>
<p>It was, after all, in this&mdash;in his personal influence&mdash;that
Mr. Maurice was greatest.&nbsp; True, he was a great and rare thinker.&nbsp;
Those who wish to satisfy themselves of this should measure the capaciousness
of his intellect by studying&mdash;not by merely reading&mdash;his Boyle
Lectures on the Religions of the world; and that Kingdom of Christ,
the ablest &ldquo;Apology&rdquo; for the Catholic Faith which England
has seen for more than two hundred years.&nbsp; The ablest, and perhaps
practically the most successful; for it has made the Catholic Faith
look living, rational, practical, and practicable, to hundreds who could
rest neither in modified Puritanism nor modified Romanism, and still
less in scepticism, however earnest.&nbsp; The fact that it is written
from a Realist point of view, as all Mr. Maurice&rsquo;s books are,
will make it obscure to many readers.&nbsp; Nominalism is just now so
utterly in the ascendant, that most persons seem to have lost the power
of thinking, as well as of talking, by any other method.&nbsp; But when
the tide of thought shall turn, this, and the rest of Mr. Maurice&rsquo;s
works, will become not only precious but luminous, to a generation which
will have recollected that substance does not mean matter, that a person
is not the net result of his circumstances, and that the real is not
the visible Actual, but the invisible Ideal.</p>
<p>If anyone, again, would test Mr. Maurice&rsquo;s faculty as an interpreter
of Scripture, let him study the two volumes on the Gospel and the Epistles
of St. John; and study, too, the two volumes on the Old Testament, which
have been (as a fact) the means of delivering more than one or two from
both the Rationalist and the Mythicist theories of interpretation.&nbsp;
I mention these only as peculiar examples of Mr. Maurice&rsquo;s power.&nbsp;
To those who have read nothing of his, I would say: &ldquo;Take up what
book you will, you will be sure to find in it something new to you,
something noble, something which, if you can act on it, will make you
a better man.&rdquo;&nbsp; And if anyone, on making the trial, should
say: &ldquo;But I do not understand the book.&nbsp; It is to me a new
world;&rdquo; then it must be answered: &ldquo;If you wish to read only
books which you can understand at first sight, confine yourself to periodical
literature.&nbsp; As for finding yourself in a new world, is it not
good sometimes to do that?&mdash;to discover how vast the universe of
mind, as well as of matter, is; that it contains many worlds; and that
wise and beautiful souls may and do live in more worlds than your own?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Much has been said of the obscurity of Mr. Maurice&rsquo;s style.&nbsp;
It is a question whether any great thinker will be anything but obscure
at times; simply because he is possessed by conceptions beyond his powers
of expression.&nbsp; But the conceptions may be clear enough; and it
may be worth the wise man&rsquo;s while to search for them under the
imperfect words.&nbsp; Only thus&mdash;to take an illustrious instance&mdash;has
St. Paul, often the most obscure of writers, become luminous to students;
and there are those who will hold that St. Paul is by no means understood
yet; and that the Calvinistic system which has been built upon his Epistles,
has been built up upon a total ignoring of the greater part of them,
and a total misunderstanding of the remainder: yet, for all that, no
Christian man will lightly shut up St. Paul as too obscure for use.&nbsp;
Really, when one considers what worthless verbiage which men have ere
now, and do still, take infinite pains to make themselves fancy that
they understand, one is tempted to impatience when men confess that
they will not take the trouble of trying to understand Mr. Maurice.</p>
<p>Yet after all, I know no work which gives a fairer measure of Mr.
Maurice&rsquo;s intellect, both political and exegetic, and a fairer
measure likewise, of the plain downright common sense which he brought
to bear on each of so many subjects, than his Commentary on the very
book which is supposed to have least connection with common sense, and
on which common sense has as yet been seldom employed&mdash;namely,
the Apocalypse of St. John.&nbsp; That his method of interpretation
is the right one can hardly be doubted by those who perceive that it
is the one and only method on which any fair exegesis is possible&mdash;namely,
to ask: What must these words have meant to those to whom they were
actually spoken?&nbsp; That Mr. Maurice is more reverent, by being more
accurate, more spiritual, by being more practical, in his interpretation
than commentators on this book have usually been, will be seen the more
the book is studied, and found to be what any and every commentary on
the Revelation ought to be&mdash;a mine of political wisdom.&nbsp; Sayings
will be found which will escape the grasp of most readers, as indeed
they do mine, so pregnant are they, and swift revealing, like the lightning-flash
at night, a whole vision: but only for a moment&rsquo;s space.&nbsp;
The reader may find also details of interpretation which are open to
doubt; if so, he will remember that no man would have shrunk with more
horror than Mr. Maurice from the assumption of infallibility.&nbsp;
Meanwhile, that the author&rsquo;s manly confidence in the reasonableness
of his method will be justified hereafter, I must hope, if the Book
of Revelation is to remain, as God grant it may, the political text-book
of the Christian Church.</p>
<p>On one matter, however, Mr. Maurice is never obscure&mdash;on questions
of right and wrong.&nbsp; As with St. Paul, his theology, however seemingly
abstruse, always results in some lesson of plain practical morality.&nbsp;
To do the right and eschew the wrong, and that not from hope of reward
or fear of punishment&mdash;in which case the right ceases to be right&mdash;but
because a man loves the right and hates the wrong; about this there
is no hesitation or evasion in Mr. Maurice&rsquo;s writings.&nbsp; If
any man is in search of a mere philosophy, like the neo-Platonists of
old, or of a mere system of dogmas, by assenting to which he will gain
a right to look down on the unorthodox, while he is absolved from the
duty of becoming a better man than he is and as good a man as he can
be&mdash;then let him beware of Mr. Maurice&rsquo;s books, lest, while
searching merely for &ldquo;thoughts that breathe,&rdquo; he should
stumble upon &ldquo;words that burn,&rdquo; and were meant to burn.&nbsp;
His books, like himself, are full of that &theta;&upsilon;&mu;&omicron;&sigmaf;,
that capacity of indignation, which Plato says is the root of all virtues.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There was something,&rdquo; it has been well said, &ldquo;so
awful, and yet so Christ-like in its awful sternness, in the expression
which came over that beautiful face when he heard of anything base or
cruel or wicked, that it brought home to the bystander our Lord&rsquo;s
judgment of sin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And here, perhaps, lay the secret of the extraordinary personal influence
which he exercised; namely, in that truly formidable element which underlaid
a character which (as one said of him) &ldquo;combined all that was
noblest in man and woman; all the tenderness and all the strength, all
the sensitiveness and all the fire, of both; and with that a humility
which made men feel the utter baseness, meanness, of all pretension.&rdquo;&nbsp;
For can there be true love without wholesome fear?&nbsp; And does not
the old Elizabethan &ldquo;My dear dread&rdquo; express the noblest
voluntary relation in which two human souls can stand to each other?&nbsp;
Perfect love casteth out fear.&nbsp; Yes: but where is love perfect
among imperfect beings, save a mother&rsquo;s for her child?&nbsp; For
all the rest, it is through fear that love is made perfect; fear which
bridles and guides the lover with awe&mdash;even though misplaced&mdash;of
the beloved one&rsquo;s perfections; with dread&mdash;never misplaced&mdash;of
the beloved one&rsquo;s contempt.&nbsp; And therefore it is that souls
who have the germ of nobleness within, are drawn to souls more noble
than themselves, just because, needing guidance, they cling to one before
whom they dare not say or do, or even think, an ignoble thing.&nbsp;
And if these higher souls are&mdash;as they usually are&mdash;not merely
formidable, but tender likewise, and true, then the influence which
they may gain is unbounded, for good&mdash;or, alas! for evil&mdash;both
to themselves and to those that worship them.&nbsp; Woe to the man who,
finding that God has given him influence over human beings for their
good, begins to use it after awhile, first only to carry out through
them his own little system of the Universe, and found a school or sect;
and at last by steady and necessary degradation, mainly to feed his
own vanity and his own animal sense of power.</p>
<p>But Mr. Maurice, above all men whom I have ever met, conquered both
these temptations.&nbsp; For, first, he had no system of the Universe.&nbsp;
To have founded a sect, or even a school, would be, he once said, a
sure sign that he was wrong and was leading others wrong.&nbsp; He was
a Catholic and a Theologian, and he wished all men to be such likewise.&nbsp;
To be so, he held, they must know God in Christ.&nbsp; If they knew
God, then with them, as with himself, they would have the key which
would unlock all knowledge, ecclesiastical, eschatological (religious,
as it is commonly called), historic, political, social.&nbsp; Nay even,
so he hoped, that knowledge of God would prove at last to be the key
to the right understanding of that physical science of which he, unfortunately
for the world, knew but too little, but which he accepted with a loyal
trust in God, and in fact as the voice of God, which won him respect
and love from men of science to whom his theology was a foreign world.&nbsp;
If he could make men know God, and therefore if he could make men know
that God was teaching them; that no man could see a thing unless God
first showed it to him&mdash;then all would go well, and they might
follow the Logos, with old Socrates, whithersoever he led.&nbsp; Therefore
he tried not so much to alter men&rsquo;s convictions, as, like Socrates,
to make them respect their own convictions, to be true to their own
deepest instincts, true to the very words which they used so carelessly,
ignorant alike of their meaning and their wealth.&nbsp; He wished all
men, all churches, all nations, to be true to the light which they had
already, to whatsoever was godlike, and therefore God-given, in their
own thoughts; and so to rise from their partial apprehensions, their
scattered gleams of light, toward that full knowledge and light which
was contained&mdash;so he said, even with his dying lips&mdash;in the
orthodox Catholic faith.&nbsp; This was the ideal of the man and his
work; and it left him neither courage nor time to found a school or
promulgate a system.&nbsp; God had His own system: a system vaster than
Augustine&rsquo;s, vaster than Dante&rsquo;s, vaster than all the thoughts
of all thinkers, orthodox and heterodox, put together; for God was His
own system, and by Him all thing&rsquo;s consisted, and in Him they
lived and moved and had their being; and He was here, living and working,
and we were living and working in Him, and had, instead of building
systems of our own, to find out His eternal laws for men, for nations,
for churches; for only in obedience to them is Life.&nbsp; Yes, a man
who held this could found no system.&nbsp; &ldquo;Other foundation,&rdquo;
he used to say, &ldquo;can no man lay, save that which is laid, even
Jesus Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; And as he said it, his voice and eye told
those who heard him that it was to him the most potent, the most inevitable,
the most terrible, and yet the most hopeful, of all facts.</p>
<p>As for temptations to vanity, and love of power&mdash;he may have
had to fight with them in the heyday of youth, and genius, and perhaps
ambition.&nbsp; But the stories of his childhood are stories of the
same generosity, courtesy, unselfishness, which graced his later years.&nbsp;
At least, if he had been tempted, he had conquered.&nbsp; In more than
five-and-twenty years, I have known no being so utterly unselfish, so
utterly humble, so utterly careless of power or influence, for the mere
enjoyment&mdash;and a terrible enjoyment it is&mdash;of using them.&nbsp;
Staunch to his own opinion only when it seemed to involve some moral
principle, he was almost too ready to yield it, in all practical matters,
to anyone whom he supposed to possess more practical knowledge than
he.&nbsp; To distrust himself, to accuse himself, to confess his proneness
to hard judgments, while, to the eye of those who knew him and the facts,
he was exercising a splendid charity and magnanimity; to hold himself
up as a warning of &ldquo;wasted time,&rdquo; while he was, but too
literally, working himself to death&mdash;this was the childlike temper
which made some lower spirits now and then glad to escape from their
consciousness of his superiority by patronising and pitying him; causing
in him&mdash;for he was, as all such great men are like to be, instinct
with genial humour&mdash;a certain quiet good-natured amusement, but
nothing more.</p>
<p>But it was that very humility, that very self-distrust, combined
so strangely with manful strength and sternness, which drew to him humble
souls, self-distrustful souls, who, like him, were full of the &ldquo;Divine
discontent;&rdquo; who lived&mdash;as perhaps all men should live&mdash;angry
with themselves, ashamed of themselves, and more and more angry and
ashamed as their own ideal grew, and with it their consciousness of
defection from that ideal.&nbsp; To him, as to David in the wilderness,
gathered those who were spiritually discontented and spiritually in
debt; and he was a captain over them, because, like David, he talked
to them, not of his own genius or his own doctrines, but of the Living
God, who had helped their forefathers, and would help them likewise.&nbsp;
How great his influence was; what an amount of teaching, consolation,
reproof, instruction in righteousness, that man found time to pour into
heart after heart, with a fit word for man and for woman; how wide his
sympathies, how deep his understanding of the human heart; how many
sorrows he has lightened; how many wandering feet set right, will never
be known till the day when the secrets of all hearts are disclosed.&nbsp;
His forthcoming biography, if, as is hoped, it contains a selection
from his vast correspondence, will tell something of all this: but how
little!&nbsp; The most valuable of his letters will be those which were
meant for no eye but the recipient&rsquo;s, and which no recipient would
give to the world&mdash;hardly to an ideal Church; and what he has done
will have to be estimated by wise men hereafter, when (as in the case
of most great geniuses) a hundred indirect influences, subtle, various,
often seemingly contradictory, will be found to have had their origin
in Frederick Maurice.</p>
<p>And thus I end what little I have dared to say.&nbsp; There is much
behind, even more worth saying, which must not be said.&nbsp; Perhaps
some far wiser men than I will think that I have said too much already,
and be inclined to answer me as Elisha of old answered the over-meddling
sons of the prophets:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knowest thou that the Lord will take away thy master from
thy head to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, I know it: hold ye your peace.&rdquo;</p>

Since this was written, Mrs. Jameson&rsquo;s volume on the Legends of
the Madonna has succeeded excellently in giving us, if not a complete,
yet still a readable and modest picture of medieval Mariolatry.</p>
<p><a name="footnote210"></a><a href="#citation210">{210}</a>&nbsp;
We are sorry to see, however, that Mrs. Jameson has been so far untrue
to her own faculty as to join in the common mistake of naming Raphael&rsquo;s
well-known cartoon at Hampton Court, &ldquo;Elymas the Sorcerer struck
Blind.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the supposition that this is its subject, its
method of arrangement is quite unworthy of the rest, as the action would
be split into the opposite corners of the picture, and the post of honour
in the centre occupied by a figure of secondary importance; besides,
the picture would lose its significance as one of this great series
on &ldquo;Religious Conviction and Conversion.&rdquo;&nbsp; But, strange
to say, Raphael has all the while especially guarded against this very
error, by labelling the picture with a description of its subject.&nbsp;
Directly under the central figure is written, &ldquo;Sergius Paulus,
Proconsul, embraces the Christian faith at the preaching of Paul.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Taking which simple hint, and looking at the face of the proconsul (himself
a miracle of psychology) as the centre to which all is to be referred,
the whole composition, down to the minutest details, arranges itself
at once in that marvellous unity which is Raphael&rsquo;s especial glory.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
